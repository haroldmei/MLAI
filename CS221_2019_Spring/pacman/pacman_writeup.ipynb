Firstly I use number of food in square $\\text{foodgrid}_{p_0-\\text{offset} \\dots p_0+\\text{offset}, p_1-\\text{offset} \\dots p_1+\\text{offset}}$, then used $\\sum \\frac{1.0}{\\text{distance}(p,(x,y))}$ but neither achieve good results. Then changed to $\\frac{c1}{2^{\\text{distance}}}$ incorporated with the following ghost related feature makes things work.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. distance to ghost, should avoid going too close to ghost. Feature extracted is $-\\frac{c2}{\\text{distance}}$. Here need to redeem a positive fraction when the ghost is in scary state. The redeemed number is $\\frac{10\\times c2}{\\text{distance}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. distance to capsule, trying to make higher reward when close to capsules, but doesn't seem to help much. The reason I guess should be related to movement flexibility: When pacman is cornered, it is very easy to be eaten by ghost.\n",
