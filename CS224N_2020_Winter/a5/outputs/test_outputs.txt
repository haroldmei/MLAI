You know that what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, reading in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can dress as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphany.
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell out somewhere.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epiphany.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Berkeley.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the 1960s in the middle school, in Utah, Ohio where I was the freak of class.
When they were beaten to bleed every week in the kids' bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by allowing me to come into the bathroom of the teacher room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to get out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the '80s, I felt the need to start working on organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that teacher, the lady who said,``I need to see you.
I'm disillusioned that of adults we never get to know ourselves.
You could come to Ohio, and please bring that guy that you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to join you with this please . ''
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.
We went to see it, we laughed, we cried, and we realized that she needed to be participated.
We found a place, we love it, and we took care of his family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to meet as an adult came to meet me, it became a baby box, and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked about was done in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life needs.
I need truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today that I talked about this today.
It also needs dignity, love and pleasure, and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first machines.
I was amazed.
My heart pounding, I was dizzy, trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the water, almost 60 meters, and I couldn't think that it was a snowflake about another seven year-old snowflake after year.
The columns are born when they fall out of glaciers or break the ice barriers.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up, and they were clinging up until the end, while others can't support it more and fall into a dramatic passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a iceberg, that are isolated and lonely, as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a iceberg melts, I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As you melt a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I approached to photograph these columns as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are only that way and they will not exist again.
It's not death when they melt; it's not a end, but a continuation of its way by the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the columns that photography is very young -- it's a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last photos I'd like to show you are a iceberg that I photographed in Keplane, Greenland.
It's short to actually get to witness a mutant iceberg.
Here you have it.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and their floating line.
You can see here, it starts to roll, the ship has moved on the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a Greenland iceberg, average size.
It's about 120 feet about 120 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so, you know, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each containing a baby . Okay.
So two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much on the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about your conception, you won't pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm is joined to the chromosomes X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X chromosome of the sperm joins the X chromosome of the egg.
They both lose and start life.
Let's talk about them later.
In my business activity, I will have two roles.
In one of my roles, I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a historian historian, and what I study in this case is the way people open the anatomy -- to say, of human and animal bodies, how they have considered the body fluids, the idea of the body, what they thought about the body.
The other role that I performance in my work is the activist, as a patient advocate, or, as I say sometimes, advocate from people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with honest twins, two people within a body.
I've worked with people with dinner, much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with outliers, individuals whose physical topology doesn't fit in male schemes and conventional female.
In general lines, we can call it international.
The sexuality embraces many ways.
I'm going to put you some examples in ways of having a sex that is not carved in the male or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual with French democratic base, which is the GPS gene of chromosome, and he tells the priorities, that we all have in the fetal life, that they become testes.
And then, in the eastern life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks from testosterone receptors, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of inherent sensitivity.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops by following a typically female course.
When the baby is born, the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl . It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing them, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having ovaries and uterus, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really that way.
Women, like men, have in the body something called sub-Saharan glands.
They're in the front of the body.
The supermarket glands produce the normal glands, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I'm considered a typical woman; I don't know his fatty structure; I believe to be a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the openings.
We produce openings and respond to the openings.
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the openings that the woman who was born with testes who have the syndrome of sensitivity to the openings.
So sex is a complicated thing . It's not that the sex are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old boy born and raised as they would vary -- he had girlfriend, and sexual relations with her, he had a life as a kid and just found out that I had ovaries and uterus.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as a conflict that was a conflict.
It had 200-year-old chromosomes, and in the womb, the underground glands were so active that, essentially, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their genitals were manufactured, their brain was exposed to the typical hormone component.
He was born with a child's point; no one suspected anything.
And it was at 19 years old when he started having medical problems caused by the internal menstruation, when doctors found that, in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of an interface case.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as viewers, which is, they've got wind tissue wrapped in the testicular tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- -- whether they're dwarf, simple twins, or sexual surgery, is not to be able to make a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat for our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings out a particular identity.
We have the idea that being female is to have female identity; supposedly, being black means to have African anatomy in historical terms.
A terrible simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the category.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture, that's our culture.
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept.
Imagine how amazing it is to have kids who are born as two people within a body.
The latest recent case is last year with the South African runner, Carolina Temaschie; he put his sex in the International Games of Berlin.
A lot of reporters called to ask me,``What are they going to do to determine if Christian Is a man or woman? ''
And I had to explain to reporters that there is no such examination.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a blank line between men and women or men and women and women, and we are who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more advanced science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable anatomical categories that are being told directly with stable secondary categories -- they're much more difficult than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology allows.
As we see, we get into a strange terrain.
So, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we think about the fact that we can make fun of them in just a few nuclear?
And as we progress in science, we get more and more in an uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories that we're driving are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all the human lives.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the fetus.
There are very heated discussions today, maybe not in public, but I know within medicine that when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to travel with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still didn't understand it.
If I stopped moving it.
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we need to face the dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could make someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, I'm defending people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
I'm going to know that these categories are much more unstable than we were thinking about.
Consider from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a liberating fortune of the founding parents.
I know they were racist, I know they were sexist, but they were big.
I mean, they were so courageous and audacious and so radical on what they did, that I find each of you watching that musical curve``1973"and not for music, which is totally possible.
That's why it happened in 1973 with the founding fathers.
The founding fathers were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explains why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everyone remember, what our founding parents did was the idea of the monarchy . The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old monories of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth right.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it came to the political power on the right of blood feeding from the grandfather to father and then the child, etc.
The founding parents rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomical concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They leveled the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not anatomic differences . That was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of an outbreak system where two things were being spent.
The democracy was being generated, and at the same time, it was born science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the founding parents, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were getting away from the supernatural explanation, and therefore they rejected the concept of supernatural power, transmitted by a vague idea of birth right.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of Independence, they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequences, we were transferring the idea of anatomical consciousness.
And by doing that, they were sitting the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years later?
And women succeeded.
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the Southern Structure's people who said,``I'm not a woman? ''
We found men in the Civil Rights movement, saying,``I'm a man.
And again, people of color who were able to have the anatomical coincidence about anatomical difference, and again, they succeeded.
We see the same with the Mandard of disability.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the coincidence, we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain divisions.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomic divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't mean that we had to give up to anatomy.
I don't mean that the five-year-old children were allowed to be allowed to have sex or marry.
There are some anatomic divisions that make sense and that I think we should keep.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings that are perceived at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings, both conceived in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before: June 1 in 1980.
Henry, on the opposite, was born: I was born March 1 in March.
For the only fact of having born three months before Mary is attributed every rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
Henry has to wait for all of that because it has a different biological age, but because he was born after.
We found other features in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered man -- if I haven't told you if it's John, in virtue of being considered man now is possible from the mandatory model that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on his part, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman alone in some states.
So they still persist bacterial categories that in various ways are problematic and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science advances both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a based democracy could be triggered?
I don't want to give science to science, but at the same time I feel like science comes up to us.
Where are we going?
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude,```` Well, we have to plot the line somewhere, so we're going to do it . ''
But many people are stuck in a rare position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man doesn't have to have chromosomes, and to marry a woman, you have to have chromosomes.
Now, in practice don't do remote exams to people.
But this is also very strange as the story that I told you at the beginning of the heightened syndrome to the openings.
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech,``I have a solution.
It says we should judge people,``based on not the color of their skin, but in the content of their character ,"going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say,``Yeah, the idea seems very good . ''
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on their character?
I want to point as well that I'm not sure that we should be based on this to ensure people, because I've got to admit that I know from some of them who are going to be more likely to deserve social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some speakers I know can make more informed, intelligent and mature decisions about their sexual relationships than people who I know.
So how do you put the issue of the content content?
It's very difficult.
And one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future will be measured with an instrument, maybe with MRI.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continues to lead this belief of thinking in relation to democracy issue.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we will do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to take a sex change, in whose case it's allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of years ago that he had made a few months to give birth twins, and then to separate them, and that's what his fame is.
But when the phone asked the reason of operation was a very risky operation, I was told that in that other country, these kids would be very battered and therefore I had to.
And I said,``Well, have you considered the political asylum instead of the surgical separation? ''
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are without forced to change for the state of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up, I mean I've been talking a lot about parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to mothers.
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different anatomic topology, in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years, since I've been interested in sexuality, I've also been interested in investigating sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in me are the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about cultural studies is that women, on average, not all, but in average they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A years ago, when I was in the graduate, one of my advisers I knew that I was interested in feminism -- I was considered feminist, as I now made a strange plant.
\" Tell me what the feminism has . ''
And I thought,``I'm the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with destroying gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in feminism . ''
But the more I've thought about his question, the more it has seemed to me that there's something female in feminism.
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attentive to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So, if the parents were very attentive to find a way to protect people from the state, it's possible that, to have injected more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with reciprocal support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy: thinking less about the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect unit, let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to remember how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, it has the possibility to choose between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to receive them.
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are much more than their cost of construction.
So we could easily deliver the world, maybe hundreds, new cities.
Well, this can sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replace them by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments, they were already owners, and that the other half was still required to do it.
They could try to increase the capacity by making sneakers in all of existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you face is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the ailments and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those galaxies.
But they could go to a completely new place, build a completely new apartment building, and when the rules of that place facilitate the construction rather than putting it.
So I proposed that governments to create new amounts of big enough reform to contain cities and gave them a name: cities under a status.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, Justine and Connecticut were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 Americans would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask questions what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, he passed through a standard constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, Pete Ford was inspired by a platform in which I promise reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked Connecticut to be his cabinet boss.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of mating, trial and error and a lot of trials with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current apartments of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like norms to progress, and usually it's the norms that prevent us to move forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to Connecticut a link with the TEDTalk.
I showed it to Jane.
They called me.
They said,``Let's show this to the leaders of our country.
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York, Notice -- terrain that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion, and at some point, when there was a pause, Connecticut said,``Paul, maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk . ''
And the talk in terms of very simple terms that a city under a status is a place where you start with destroyed terrain, a status that specifies the rules that are going to apply there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Honduras called me, and he said we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
I was asked to go to Guineal and talk about new four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in Denver.
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the entrepreneurs that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that I measured at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is totally crushed.
The public faces were very serious and attentive.
The Congress leader came to the platform and said,``Professor Roman, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have this here in my computer . ''
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained the essential -- that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option from a city to which you might be in Honduras, instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And it also includes new options for leaders.
Because the government government leaders would need help of associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that would help them set up and make the status of the status, so that they could all trust that the status is effectively.
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
I could easily grab a thousand square miles.
And shortly later, on January 19th, they voted in Congress to send their constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I've just passed through this painful crisis, the vote in Congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 14 to one.
All of the parties, all the factions in society, supported it.
To include the Constitution, you have to work twice in Congress.
The 17th of February was passed again in another voting, from 144 to one.
Immediately after voting, from 21 to February 24, a delegation of about 30 acres went to two places in the world that are more interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new great city center in the city that's built in South Korea, it's bigger than the Boston center.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years getting permission.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it in practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow managers to come, and at once allowed to operate under an external legal system.
One country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate length for this new judicial system.
There are statistics and cities of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to be installed in the Americas, especially in a place with a free business zone, and there are many people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they'd like to switch immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go get a job; sometimes they are unwed mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even kids are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in Honduras?
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my senior friends asked me to say,``Thank you TED . ''
I'm Jesus, and this is my courage.
But before you show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession, and that is, I live obsessed with the suits.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photographing and publish in my blog, bold suits, colorful and different for every single time.
But it doesn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of waste markets and shops of second hand.
Ah, thank you.
Second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my paradigm in the environment and in my wallet.
I come to know interesting people; usually my money goes to a good cause; my aspect is unique; and buy becomes my personal search for treasures.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
To my neck?
I want color?
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
I want to tell you what I packed for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
underwear for exactly a week is all I've put in my journey.
I thought I would be able to find everything else I wanted to use after arriving here to Palm Springs.
And since you don't know me as the woman who walks through TED in underwear, that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
Doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the life lessons that, believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called bright tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You almost can see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
The whole set, including the jacket, costs me 55, and it's the most expensive I've used in the week.
Monday: color is energy.
It's almost physiologically impossible to be grumpy, when you're looking at a bright red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars: The integration is saved.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time to integrate.
You just know yourself.
If you get around the right people, you're not just going to understand you, you'll also appreciate you.
Wednesday: The kid that you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the Enjoy, or I remember you to their seven-year-old.
I like to come to you and say,``Thank you . ''
Thursday: The trust is the key.
If you think you're looking good with something, it's pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, probably it's true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, there's no eyes you can't attract.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
Friday: A universal truth six words for you: The golden tunnels go with everything.
And finally, Saturday: developing a personal, unique style is a great way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people approached me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave some things.
I don't need to get away emotionally to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another crazy, colorful suit to me, if there's a little love in my heart and search.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we used a scale to measure the competence of each hemisphere, we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you put your brain on this scale?
Some would opt through one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a great disability in both hemispheres at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually exclusive.
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most other physical quantum physicists, we need quite logical to connect these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need enough intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this intuition? Well, we like to play with things.
We set up playing with them, and then we see how they react, and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Now, some intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only one place at a time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you didn't have this notion, they developed it.
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and he didn't do it very well, it always fell.
But I bet that the game with that parking bar taught you a valuable lesson, and it's that big things don't allow the transplant, and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you to be a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for particle physics, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they find that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like they can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago; they needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a particle.
But it didn't fit well to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics?
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics overlap.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to extend a little bit . It's right in the center.
And then here we make a good close-up approach to the small metal season.
What we see is a small little bit of metal, with the form of springboard, and that underlies support in a platform.
And so I did this almost like the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this physicist with a form of swimming swimming, which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum assumption, but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in a elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people come up to stop doing those things, because I don't want to bother you, or actually scare.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey of travel objects are not only people, it's also the light that shines it and the wind passing next to the room and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal, it behaves according to quantum mechanics, we would have to push all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We turn off the lights, then we introduced a vacuum cleaners and extracted all the air, and then we plug it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, by being only on the elevator, the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moves in very strange forms.
Instead of staying perfectly, I was vibrating, and the way I would vibrate was like a breathing like this -- as a result that expands and contract.
And by giving it a soft push, we were able to make it vibrate and don't go back at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a thing will vibrate and don't go back at the same time?
So let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make that metal piece of metal are set, and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in certain times when they align.
In the rest of the time they are destroyed.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It's worth mentioning in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that metal piece of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you?
I mean, it's my logical part that speaks.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, what would that be??
How do you act your consciousness if your body was sitting in space?
There's another part of history.
And it's when we heat it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal followed there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just made in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Matt.
And 18 months ago I did another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss, and it allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories are safe, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demo.
There are a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story is just explaining in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I heard from a great education -- I didn't complain, but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire of making it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
More than it shows the demo for then to explain a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from their launch.
So just, we go to Mobile.
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the Friday gallery, the MoMA, the Asia, the Robins, the Van Shery.
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, the Metropolitan, the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and, Mom, we're already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, Bombay or Mexico, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and fun.
Do you want to navigate for the museum?
We open up the top plane, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall.
They go forward . They're fun!
They explore.
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm standing in front of one of my favorite paintings,``The consumers ,"of Pieter Gilbert at the Metropolitan.
I see the sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the metadata of metadata.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the violence technology.
So this image, for example, contains, I think, about 10 billion pixels.
And there are many people who ask me,``What do you get with 10,000 billion pixels?
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 billion pixels.
It can make Delhi around a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to delve.
So I started playing, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said,``Wait a moment, this looks interesting . ''
I came in and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
I was talking a little bit, I talked to some people from the Metropolitan, and I actually found out that this is a game called``incomprehensible],"which is to hit a stick with a stick on the Tuesday Tuesday.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further in deep, and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to skip the image, so you'll really see what's there.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go back to MoMA again in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites,``The Night Spain . ''
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the brush?
And if you want to see how John Gogh actually created this masterpiece?
I increase it and really do it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is``The Night star ,"I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part . It's called``collections . ''
All of you, absolutely everybody, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a mansion, that gives you the same.
You can online your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we go in, -- I created this function that I call``The power of the Book ,"we just made a robot around.
It's``The ambassadors"in London National Gallery.
You can do things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these master masterpieces.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes justice to his artwork and that it's represented properly online.
And the big question you do today is,``did you do this to repeat the experience of going to a museum? ''
And the answer is not.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it . Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon to everybody.
I have something to show you.
You think it's a pixel, a flying pixel.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian origin, all kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom, but the reason I show you this is that it has happened very interesting in Formula 1, in the last two decades.
Now, sometime, if you wanted to win a Formula 1 career, you would take a budget and betting it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you would win the career.
This is what, in engineering, is called control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two components: a sensor and an accident.
What's interesting is that control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered from networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer outdoors.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and accessible.
The cities is a big thing.
As a note, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption -- and to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be big.
Beyond cities, all these detection and activation are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Park Anderson in the MoMA, during the summer.
It's called``Japan.
Well, our objects, the environment, they start talking.
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and actuators.
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the external environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo.
You know, when Michelangelo carved the Moses, he says that at the end he took the hammer, and he threw it down to the Moses -- you can still see a little mile underneath, and he said,``Didn't you talk? ''
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts talking to us.
And I'm going to show you just a few examples, and I'm thinking about the idea of capturing the environment and to do something.
Let's start with detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember it, and they played Italy and France, and at the end of Civil gave the head.
And anyway, eventually won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day observing activity happened in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Coliseum in the middle and the River River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline is on the top.
At the early evening there are people over here, and there they're calling, moving.
It starts the game: silence.
North France . Wow from Italy.
You know, the people make a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time . End of the regime time.
The first extra time -- second.
Contaminator, and at a moment, the head.
win Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to celebrate the center.
You see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center to the winning team and the first minister of the world.
And then everybody went down.
You see the picture of the place called circus Rose where, from the Roman age, people are going to celebrate; it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another rapid example of detection: it's not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today we know all about the process of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a Mac, how they assemble.
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to label what they were throwing -- different kinds of things, as you can see, things that would all pull out.
Then we put a little chip, a tag, to the trash, and then we started tracking it.
These are the results obtained.
From Seattle.
after a week.
So with this information, we realized that there are many ineffective in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist before.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that we throw doesn't disappear, that it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we throw up one day is still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague at MIT, Sarah Archaesce, could tell us much more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is to get to the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in Palestinian.
It all started with a question of the city mayor, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, will join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was: imagine that they have a car and valves, solar valves, angels that open up and close.
It's created as a water curtain, with water pixels.
If you fall up the pixels, you can write in them, show patterns, images, text.
And when you zoom closer, the curtain will open up so that we can go through, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the speeds mayor.
He liked it a lot.
And I gave a commission to design the building to the entrance of the expo.
We call it General Glad General.
The whole building is made of water.
There's no doors or windows, but when you're approaching it so you can go through.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the bandwides, you go down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the ceiling, someone who was there and said,``They demolish the building.
No, it's not that they have demolished it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture disappears.
This is in work.
You see people who are intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to do not better at testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children from hacking came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was opened to let me go, but a building that kept making cut and holes of water, and you had to jump out not to get wet.
( Noise noise) And for us, that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with physical pixels, water pixels, and projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different kind.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then that all of that could be a piece of pixels in 3D where you can zoom up and go through, and see from very different angles.
This is the true controlled definition, going down to form a V, like before.
When you turn the light, you see this . The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bolly -- one of the best ballet dancers today, the New York City star in New York City to capture their 3D movements and use them as entry to the Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pixels, I capture it in different resolution.
It's so much 3D 3D so much like motion capture.
It can rebuild the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels, we can play with them, with color and movement, gravity and rotation.
We want to use this as a possible entry for the Florida.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the Olympics of London.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment, like a cloud of clouds like the care of barn, but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make everybody a little bit of a pixel.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last couple of years is that, in the last two decades, we move from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time, the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this might be we wanted to use it to design and make a symbol.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to tackle the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions . How do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people become involved in doing this together, collectively.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered from pixels.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, you can serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital party at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just some changes in their genes, they could improve memory -- for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they'd like to be in better ways, to be stronger, have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and secure from themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe it's those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like?
What would you like, if you could choose something?
( Audience Member: creativity .) creativity.
How many people choose creativity?
Hands up . Let me see.
A few . It's probably due to the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many would you choose memory?
A few more.
What about the physical state?
A little less.
How about longevity?
There, most . That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this, the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a person here at the TED conference, but today I want to give you a look at a doctor's gaze.
The great 20th century 20th of the 20th century, Turkey . Hawking, who also passed on the Church Orthodox Church, wrote a trial called``None in biology makes sense of the light of evolution . ''
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: Is it just about the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on an extreme, is, of course, the one that we're most interested in.
From a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interval, there have been maybe 20 different species of hominids.
Some of them have gone and go back.
We've been here about 130,000 years.
We might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly, the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that's used to treat diabetes?
This is not like human insulin; it's the same protein, it's chemically intangible, which comes out of the pancreas.
And talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we all take the most bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, do you think -- when I'm Antonio Mas, what do you do -- think about bacteria?
The gut is a beautifully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark, moist, is very evocative.
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that you can want without effort of their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional switch of some force force towards the output.
But, by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest essential nutrients, and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future look like?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or are you going to become something different, maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief shopping -- the animal kingdom, as one and only company, and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk, so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I first came to college, I had my first biology class.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental: in most of the existence of life, in single-celled organisms, each cell is simply divided and all the genetic energy in that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when the multicellular organisms appear, things start to change.
It enters the sexual reproduction.
And something very important: with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes predictable.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the body death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I thought,``Oxygen, Oxygen ,"by sex, seemed pretty reasonable at that moment, but with every year that happened, every time I had more doubt.
I came to understand George Burns's feelings, which still performed on Las Vegas well in their 90s.
And one night hit their hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him, he finds a magnificent dancer of clothing.
He looks at it and he says,``I come in search of a sex soup.
\" Okay ,"he says George,``I choose the soup . ''
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier.
Evolution is to pass the genome into the next generation, adapting and survival generation after generation.
From an evolutionary standpoint, you and I are as collective rockets designed to send your genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen said when he said,``I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to do it not dying . ''
Evolution doesn't necessarily favor longevity.
They don't necessarily favor the biggest or to the louder or the faster and even more intelligent.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, the film bacteria that can survive the heat of the strawberry that will produce, if there were fish there, fish in the vacuum, however, have managed to do that a self-driving environment.
So what does this mean, when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if you look forward, the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that by medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been dismissed and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've built our environment to adapt to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we migrated, we circle, and we mixed up so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation required for evolution.
A second possibility is that a kind of traditional evolution is produced, natural, imposed by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution wheels slowly, but they're invisible.
And in terms of insulation: when as a species we put distant planets, there are going to be isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there's a third possibility, an attractive, intriguing possibility.
The evolutionary call, the new evolution, which is not just natural -- but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the decisions we will take.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose at the individual and family level.
Think also that if it could be able to choose not only the sex of your offspring, but in your own body doing the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent diseases.
What if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating the push?
Wouldn't you want to make those changes in their genes?
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
Human Genome Project started in 1990 and 12 years old.
It cost 2003 billion dollars.
The next year of having finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a cost near $20,000 and in a week.
It won't be a lot to make the human genome reality for $1,000 and being increasingly aware of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to drive against other viruses.
Believe, or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against influenza cells in a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the tobacco?
That's reality today, and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only two little changes.
Can you change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their offspring?
And if you could change sperm and eggs, or change the newly fertilized flight, and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate the hormone, reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children?
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine of science that changes the changes to prevent diseases are going to allow us to adopt hyperactive cooperation -- a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennings especially if you could increase it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Why don't you have a faster contract muscle that allows us to run faster and more distances?
Why not live longer?
This is going to be irresistible.
And when we're in conditions of applying this to the next generation, and we could adopt the attributes that we wanted to have converted the evolution of before in the evolution.
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years, and we can compress it to 1,000 years, and maybe it happens within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, will have before.
Are we going to use these options in a better, more successful society, more considered?
Or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
Are we going to build a society that's more boring and more uniform or more robust?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing: Are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom required to make these decisions right?
For good or bad, and before what I could think, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor clicking, click, click.
Clare, click, click, click . Sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day . I was sitting in the 12th.
It was the only one I could talk to the flight stations.
So immediately I looked at them, and they said,``No problem . We probably hit some birds.
The pilot had looked at the plane, and we were not so far away.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lined the plane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not the route.
It took the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and without noise.
And then he said three words.
The three most disruptive words I've heard.
He said,``preparing for the impact.
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terror . Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get to and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to repair, all the experiences I've wanted to have and I never had.
As I thought about that later, I came up with a phrase, which is,``collects bad wine . ''
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open it up.
I don't want to add anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has actually changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while we were sending the George Washington Bridge, which wasn't very much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great weigh.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve in everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that they didn't care with people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a measure at that, I decided to eliminate negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
You feel wonder.
I'm no longer trying to have right; choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes down,``15 , 14 , 13.
You see the water approach.
I'm saying,``Please fly.
I don't want this to break in 20 pieces as you see in those documentary dimensions.
And as we went down, I had the feeling of, wow, die not fear.
It's almost like we've been preparing for that all of our lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness became a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- -- still . And scream, cry, like a little.
And for me, that was all the reason to be the world.
In that point I understood, when I connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was given a miracle, not dying that day.
And I came up with another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You're flying today, I challenge you to imagine that the same thing is going on in your airplane -- and please don't -- but imagine, how would you change?
What would you do, you still expect to do because they think they're going to live forever?
How would they change their relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are you the best parents who can?
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was this guy.
The guy is called TEDTalks.
EEG was one of the most important graffiti graffiti in the '80s.
One day he came to his house after running and said,``Dad, I feel a hero in the legs.
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today 2015 has a total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, and so obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony, TEDTalks, and its cause.
So I went and met with her brother and father and I said,``We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it? ''
And his brother said,``I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he is able to communicate with me . ''
And I said,``One second, isn't I that I saw Stephen Hawking is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices? ''
And he said,``No, unless you're important and you have a very good insurance, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people . ''
And I said,``Well, how do you communicate then? ''
Does anyone see the movie``The Santairot and the butterfly"?
They communicate that way -- they're hitting it with the finger.
I said,``That's archaic . How can it be? ''
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that had no idea how I was going to cover.
I committed to her brother and his father there at that precise moment,``very well, this is the deal: Tony's going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to go back to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who's got so much on their inside can't communicate . ''
So I talked to a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called Google Research Lab, who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface, and then, with a laser pointer, they draw on that and register negative space.
So they go around making art installations like this.
All the things that appear, they say, are part of a cycle of life.
First you start with sex organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush, and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their presentations.
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move things back to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of insurance companies and we got a machine so that EEG could communicate -- a machine like Stephen Hawking.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun thing -- I call it The Tomorrow because when I talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you say,``Don't deserve . This guy's fantastic . ''
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers around the world literally from all the corners of the planet to our house.
My wife, children and I, moved to the back garage and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy and anti-makers took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid, and when we went back, they would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place there would be graffiti.
But for two weeks we program, we went to the rise of Venice, my son was part, my dog too, and we created this.
It's called Electric [2006] and you can see the description.
They're a pair of cheap sunglasses that we buy in the rise of Venice Beach, some copper wire and things from Home Depp and Radio Shack.
We took a company, we open it up, we put it up on a LED light, and now there's a device that's free -- it's built for yourself; we published the free code, the software is low in free form.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says``no.
There's no hospital who can say``no . ''
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we go back to TEDTalks.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was this whole black and short of the big opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense sessions all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking wall of the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine what the feeling was in parking.
The funny thing was that we had to break in the parking, so we felt like we were legitimacy as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email, and this was what he said,``This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I'd been underwater, and somebody finally came to rescue me, and I would get out there so I could breathe . ''
Isn't that wonderful?
That's our war scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a magic screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and faster.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's free; none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were like,``Oh, this is fantastic . ''
Armstrong tweeted something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all this -- and this is what ends up closing the circle is that in April this year at the heart of MoMA in downtown Los Angeles, there's going to be an exhibition called``Art in The streets . ''
And``Art in the streets"is going to have the best speakers of urban urban art, Spanish Francisco, DARPA all are going to be there.
SPECT is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, make it possible.
None of what's in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the microphone, the collector was possible at a certain time.
Make it possible -- anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with hidden recognition technology; I just recognized something and associated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do . If it's not now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting into situations generally, and at the same time a little dangerous.
I went to jail -- difficult.
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous.
I filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been immersed in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to test social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyze them in a way that they look entertainment and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew that I came here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the sponsor wanted to do something a little different.
So, some may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago a bird in eBay.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
And what had been the following:``So the U.S. Native National presented: my TEDTalk who has no idea what it is about, and I could be able to exploit it in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company.
But he said this, it's a very good media opportunity . ''
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks?
Thank you very much.
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that hop, I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've been in horrible situations over the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could anticipate, for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan Scott: So I want to make a film that's trying to produce products, marketing and advertising, and all the film is funded with product production, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call``The largest film ever sold . ''
What happens in``The biggest film ever sold"is that all of the top down, from beginning to end, has brand images, all the time, from the audience that comes before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand, Command Street, the September Center.
These people are going to be associated with the film to feedback -- forever.
And so the film explore all this idea . (Michael Natasha: It's redundant.
I'm a redundant prison . (MK: I just say it.
It was``oil . forever . ''
But we're not just going to have the root of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we're putting all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe, and it becomes the most great shoe that you've used.
The most great car that you've driven in``The biggest film ever sold ,"the best wheat you've ever got,```` the largest film ever sold . ''
Martine Rothblatt: The idea is then, in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them funded the film? (MS: Make the film .) MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the film, from beginning to end.
And I would love that EEG help make it happen.
Robert Friedman: You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the ultimate respect for the audience.
SS: However, I don't know how responsive people are going to be.
XL: You've got a perspective -- I don't know if``````it's"very negative, but you know how it's going to repeat? (MS: No idea . David Dogi: How much money does it get to do this?
MS: One and a half million . (DC: All right .) John Kamen: I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but certainly it's going to be worth convincing a couple of big marks.
38: who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we see as a lot of joyful idiots.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Republican: Most of the answers will be``no.
MS: But will it be hard to sell it, by film or for being me?
JK: Both things.
MS :...means you're not very optimistic.
So, help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right . (MK: Okay . Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah . (MK: That's the challenge -- when you look at the people you have to deal with.
MK: We have some places where to go . (MS: Okay.
MS: I thought``shut off the camera"meant we have a conversation outside of microphone.
The camera goes,``We don't want to know anything about your film . ''
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very impressed; I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make a lot of people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to have that new worthy of attention that's going to lead the message to the masses?
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a beard error and that mistake was this.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image represents.
See, when you look for images of transparency ,"in Google appears -- this is one of the first images that appear.
I like your way to roll, Sergey Brin . No.
This was the problem: transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen -- easily understandable, which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in business practice -- being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name it, the president name, even the CEOs name it.
But suddenly when it comes to actually making something changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear -- like that weird bear that still keeps playing.
It's unpredictable -- like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is risky?
It's going to eat a whole host of Catholic Peter.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and said,``No, we want you to tell a story.
We want you to tell a story, but you tell our story . ''
See, when I was a kid, and my father caught me in some lie, and there he's looking at me as he used to say,``Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and it's the real story . ''
You see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that's just because I met John Bond and Richard Kenya from many years I realized I would have to go on my own, I would have to take on the middle and go to companies myself with my whole team.
So what I started to realize suddenly -- what I started to realize is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant movies and others who make small movies, independent, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies big, giant, say that the reason their movies have so successful is because of the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say,``Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant Hollywood movies?
And the film is called``The largest film ever sold . ''
How are we going to see Ben specifically in the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open up my bike, you'll see the Bangladesh Bang.
At any time during a interview with somebody, I can say,``Are you good enough for this interview?
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you calm.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview . ''
And there he would offer one of these fabulous weapons.
And as``Forest fusion"as```` Louises of Paradise"are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a woman, solid, to collaborator, in clay, like it.
That's the general view.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a memorized view.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
It's similar to the kind of smaller movies you've ever told, and we're rather a rival brand.
So we don't have the budget that other brands have.
So doing things like this, you know, reminding people to people is the reason why we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe Ben?
Ben is in white.
KF: That's a big question.
Volunteer: upper technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the wild.
Man: We talk about something audacious, fresh.
I think``fresh"is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus``combat smell and sweat . ''
It keeps you fresh.
How do you stay more time? With better French, more French, three times more fresh.
Things like those who highlight the benefits.
MS: And that's a billionaire company.
What about me? What about a common guy?
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the commons.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your brand?
Man: Mmm my brand?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: revive the 1980s, Parkinson published, unless it's day of laundry.
MS: Okay, what's the Virgin brand?
Interviewer: One thing . (MS: unique .) Man: I guess the type of gender, the style that I have would be like a dark glamour.
I really like dark colors, many gray and things like this.
Usually, I carry accessories like sunglasses, or I like crystals and similar.
Woman: If Dan was a brand, it could be a classic thing, Mars Benz.
Man 2: The brand I am, I'll call it a culture .'.
Woman 2: In part hippie, in a pick part, in a Bolonie, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
I sell toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little section, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because I'm sending the market.
Man 5: Mark methods failed.
Is that something?
advocating: I'm a lawyer.
Tom: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, not all of us can be brand Tom, but I'm often classified in the intersection of dark Marine and logging.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the```` music personality . ''
And I found a company called Gandhi California in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Street, Robert, Malevia to discover that personality of brand.
If they could do that for them, they could surely do it for me.
Archive: tweets the photos, right?
MS: Yeah . The first picture is a family photo.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world you live in -- like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things originated and start in a place, and in my case, they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is,``This was the best day of my life . ''
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and shape to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be.
I like different things.
I like weird things . I like weird things.
A:``Why . ''
What's the male? What phase of purple you find now?
Why is it important to reset? What is red?
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more than you, which is not who you are.
What other competitors have had?
It doesn't have to fear . What kind of Russian rollercoaster are you?
MS: Ow, thank you .) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience . (MS: Great job . A: Yes . (MS: Thank you very much .) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all of this.
Jennifer Killian: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides, but complementary, in your brand personality -- the brand Morgan Mark is a compelling brand.
They juxtaposition very well.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or on the other rather than focusing on both.
A lot of companies have -- and it's human nature to avoid the things that they're not sure; they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually do something positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is classic, Apple.
And you can also see Target, Wii, Mini de Mini Cooper and Skill.
Now there are medical marks and conscious brands, those things that have gone and come, but a technical brand is something quite powerful.
MS: A conflict mark . What's your brand??
If someone asks you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality, what would it be?
Are you a momentous attribute? Are you somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you rather a descending attribute?
A little bit more calm, reserved, conservative?
And the descending attributes are like being playful to be fresh like the prince, contemporary, adventure, bold or bold like Earth Feynman, fast or agile, toilet, magic, magic, and Australian.
Or are you rather than descending?
Are you conscious, sophisticated like 2007?
Are you established, traditional, provider, protective, do you identify with Oprah?
Are you trustworthy, stable, familiar, reliable, safe, sacred, contemplative or wise, like the Dalai Lama or The Tomorrow?
In the course of this film, we had more than 500 companies, descent and descendants, who said``no, they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control on the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the marketing, and we got to tell the story in this film of how they now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain both for commercial marketing like film.
We went to San Paulo where they banned advertising to the free air.
Throughout the city over the last five years, there are no roads, no posters, no steering, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are doing way in schools with liquidity problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or the ones I've had more success are in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands did.
They took the innovators, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat the artist directly.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you get them? Did they succeed?
Well, since the film are released in the Sunday Festival, let's take a look.
According to Burge, the film will be buried in January, and since then -- and this is not all 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a two and a half weeks.
That's just online -- no press, no TV.
The movie is still not distributed.
It's still not online . It's not in Amsterdam.
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talked about, they advise their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you risk, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in the risk of risk is preparing your entire company to lack rewards.
I feel that what you have to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can scare them.
Ultimately, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
Let's turn the fear . We're going to turn the risk.
From a spoon at once, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to hold up transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk,``we open the transparency ,"has been presented by my good friends of Comas who by $75,000 bought the rights of the name in eBay.
EDI: To make big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
Etching represents the transparency.
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, Morgan, in name of transparency, that happened exactly with those $7,500?
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket, I have a name to the name of the TED TED organization, the Saturn Foundation, a chip for $7,000 to be applied to my TED assistance of the next year.
The idea behind the content of the computer home is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the aluminum plant at Stanford in Hawaii.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and valves, we can cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge.
The gray boxes don't use Windows software; they're a completely different technology.
But if we had to put a cash virus from Windows on a laptop computer used by an engineer to figure out this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Stuxnet.
We started with a contradiction Windows.
The girl comes to the gray box, damage the centrifuge, and the nuclear nuclear program is Democrat; mission accomplished.
Is it easy, huh?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about Stuxnet six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of Windows: the installation using multiple sports vulnerabilities.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and we saw what happened to this.
So they happened very strange things.
Stuxnet was behaving as a rat of laboratory that he didn't like our cheese: the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experiencing with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a directed attack.
It's completely directed . ''
The instructor is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
If not, Stuxnet does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought,``We don't know what the target is . ''
It could be, say, for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
We better discover the goal soon.
So we extracted and we collected the attack code, and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs: a little and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points that I'll attack.
You probably even know how much the operator is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that 9/11 install is complex and high-tech, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this attack code.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much to the old display.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we looked at initially was called the system function, because we know what they do.
And then we looked at secrets and data structures and we tried to relate them with the real world, with real-world targets of the real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can approve or challenge.
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent taste, it must be a valuable white, and it's surely located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been reported.
You don't find a number of thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of Supermarket and the stage of the stage of Hawaii.
So I said to my assistant,``Give me a list of all the experts in the contractors and energy plants between our clients . ''
And he called them, and I consulted them in an effort to draw their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little bit of digital liver with the driver control.
The rotor is that cell part inside the centrifuge, that black object that you see.
If you drive the speed of this mouse, they can certainly break it and even make the centrifuge explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and discover it in an obvious effort to come back crazy to the maintenance engineers, so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital divide by observing very close to the data and their structures.
So, for example, the number 46 comes in that code, you can't be obvious.
I started researching scientific literature about how these bacteria are built in Hawaii and found that they're structured in what's called a waterfall, and each waterfall contains 104 centrifuge.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These in Iran are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the attack code?
A pretty identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So there's no such misunderstanding: it wasn't.
The results have been obtained after several weeks of hard work.
We routinely ended up in silent rooms, and we had to start back.
Yet, we found that both digital records pointed into one and same goal, but from different angles.
The small little girl is taking a waterfall, and making the rotors turn and heating them, and the big sea is communicating with six waterfalls and manipulating valves.
In sum, we're very confident that we've determined what the trigger is.
It's Natasha, and it's just Natasha.
We don't need to worry about other targets being achieved by Stuxnet.
So here I'm showing you some very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and you see the centrifuge.
What this thing does is to intercept the input values of sensors for example, pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code, which still execute during the attack, with false input data.
And, believe it or not, these false entry data is called by Saturn.
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the theft, the security camera is a legal video feed.
Is it great?
The idea here is obviously not just to cure the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive.
The idea is to fix a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the great steam turbine goes down, you have to open up escape valves in a millisecond.
Obviously, this can't make a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed, then they can happen bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the operations and the security system will notice it.
That scares.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this . This attack is generic.
It has nothing to do, specifically, with centrifuge, with uranium broadcast.
It could also work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory.
It's generic.
And you don't have -- as attacker -- that will disseminate this burden with a USB key, like we saw in the case of Stuxnet.
You could also use conventional technology technology to disseminate it.
Divermated the most possible.
And if you did that, what you end up with is a mass destruction cyber.
That's the consequence that we should face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We have to face the consequences, and we better start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph has been done in many sides that people assume that the Museum is the main entity behind this.
What's your opinion?
Ralph Latin: Okay, do you really want to hear this?
Yeah . Okay.
My view is that the Museum is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The motor behind this is cyber superpower.
There's a single one, and it's the United States, fortunately, fortunately.
Because, in another way, our problems would be even bigger.
CA: Thank you for motivation . Thank you, Ralph.
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take, and give you a breath skills, or something that makes users of wheelchair users stand up and walk back.
In``Berkeley Bionics ,"we call these robots, exoskeletons.
It's nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a great force, which also increases your speed, and helps you, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can be integrated and connecting it with the universe and with other external entities.
This is not a real idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier that, on average, has to take over your back a payload of 45 pounds, and it's being demanded to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back , 30 percent of soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the Hulk -- or World American House.
Soldier: With the holistic exoskeleton, I can cut 90 pounds per variable terrain for many hours.
It's their flexible design, it allows you to put in cameras and execute movements with great agility.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then I increase my strength and my resistance.
editor Denning: We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new exoskeleton, this year.
So it's a reality.
So let's go back now to the users of wheelchair, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people today, in wheelchair chairs, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation.
We talk about something that happens often, very young people, with damage in the spine that when they start their life -- by the age of 20 , 30 or 40 years -- they collide a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that aging it quickly quickly.
Their only choice, many times -- by a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been over the last 500 years, from its successful emergence, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the Everglades who are using Amanda John, who was 19 years ago, had a injury in the spine line, and as a result could not walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Beam: Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our Legos, which I mentioned.
It has a few sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the crutches that send signals to the onboard computer, here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give energy into the hips, and in the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a stranger jump in the air, skiing down, I was paralyzed.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all sensation and every movement of the pelvis down.
Shortly after, a doctor came to my room in the hospital, and he said,``Amanda, you never walk back.
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole myself to the last hope of my being.
The adaptation technology since then, it has allowed me to learn how to get down in ski, climbing rocks and even riding in a hand bike.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all of the wheelchair users, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the baton, practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of the Indian Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, they know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of Congo's forests.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimps are known for their aggression.
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis in this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large, terrifying types, the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society where deadly violence hasn't been observed.
But unfortunately, Bonobos are the least understanding of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle, and it's been very difficult to study them.
Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the fog itself -- scenario of a violent conflict that has been taken for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the Bonobo survival.
The meat trade and deforestation makes you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not even sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the apes```` make love, no war ,"because they have frequent and bisexual sex to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the Mama Sarama.
Bonobos, like humans, love playing throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and foster tolerance.
We learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with diversity generation -- diversity diversity, behavior diversity, diversity diversity.
And when you look at the Bonobo game, you see the evolutionary roots same of laughter, dance and human ritual.
Play is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of very unique videos of the wild.
First of all, it's a too goofy game game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a chase.
Look what she's doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase:``it's taken from the balls.
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is common both in bonobos like humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game as the testicles, and also how the game requires trust and foster trust -- and at the same time it's the most fun.
But play is molecular.
The game is political, it can adopt many ways, some of which are more quiet, imaginative, curious -- maybe the place where the wonder is discovered.
And I want you to see -- this is Francisco, a young female, who is playing with water.
I think, like, sometimes we play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and external worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real seed of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world and harder and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key of these capabilities.
In other words, play is our comfort.
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But will we leverage our game capacity?
Play is not frivolous.
Play is essential.
For Bonobo and humans alike, life is not just cruel and ruthless.
When it seems to be the least appropriate play, they can be the moments that it's most urgent.
So, primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscovered creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin Hood.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I've trained fires as a captain assistant in a body of voluntary firemen.
And in our city, where volunteers complementary a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But still there was a career to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain, I was angry in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the late night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a umbrella, in a pajamas, and his house was in flames.
The other volunteers that I had just arrived before I was, let's call it first, California Law came first to the captain, and this was asked to come in and save the dog's owner.
The dog! I was so jealous.
There was a lawyer, or money management that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building in a call to save a living being only because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain asked me.
He said,``Loo, I need to go into the house.
I need to go up, go through fire, and I bring this woman a couple of shoes . ''
I swear it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I was -- I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, happened to the real firemen, which at that height had ended up taking the fire and entered the main room in search of a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back the ladder where I met my Mas and the beautiful dog on the front door.
We pulled out of the house the treasures for the house of home where, as it was to expect, his treasure got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the owner of homes by the courageous effort to save their house.
The kindness that she watched on the top was somebody had even reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my vocation in Robin Hood like my vocation as a volunteer bomb, I'm a witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So, when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or they're going to be, remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, give you now.
They serve food in a dining, they clean up a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they enter the game; they save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Bezos: Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1864 with a very simple idea: consumer modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit of construction in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, LIGO came up with this.
It was called an automatic assembly brick.
And in a few years, LIGO bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineers to build beautiful bridges or buildings or homes.
Golinger made it accessible.
LIGO simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in Bell labs, the next revolution was about to announce: the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of aesthetic bricks piled by each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block, the transistor allows creating much bigger and more complex circuits, a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference: the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept that, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop WikiLeaks.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Pollution are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're redesigned to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they get together through magnets.
So you can't get it wrong in a wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the output, the blue is the current, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue one, and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue one with a green you produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a regulator.
If we change the button by a pulse module, which is here, and now we have a different light.
We added this doorbell to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, Little Billien are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and solidarity, laptops allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make it blink faster or slower, it just flips this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind Litching is that it's a growing collection.
We want all interactions in the world to be reduced to bricks ready to use.
Lucas, sounds, solar panels, motors; everything must be accessible.
We've given laptops to kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that doesn't learn in schools.
For example, how a light in night works, or why the door of a elevator is open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also brought plates to design schools.
So, for example, designers without any experience in electronics start playing with laptops as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and football, we have George creating.
( metallic sound) A weeks ago, we took Litching to the designers of Rhode Island's design School, who don't have any experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said,``Do something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, a confident cannon.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a locust made of Play-Doh that's afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, Litching became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the fingertips of all.
So Litching has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture them.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So ahead and invent.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is seeking to engage with the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm . Wait for a moment.
You can get a little bit better.
We can -- we can continue the video better.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, you know, do I take time?
All right . Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything they're supposed to stop; we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called Code for America, and it would be like some Peace's Peace bodies.
We select some members every year, and we put them working with the municipalities.
Instead of sending them to the Third World, we send them into the wild world.
They made great apps; they worked with the global employees.
Your task is to show the possibilities of the current technology.
You know Al.
A is a story of Boston City.
Here it appears as if I look for a quote, but what I'm really looking for is that somebody clean it when it's caught by the snow because he knows that it's not very good to fire fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it ask for help in this very unique way?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of Chinese members team.
They were there in February and at that long time last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned these hydrants.
But one of the members called Erik Michael noticed something else: than citizens cleaned on the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a hydrant.
You accept to clean it up when it snows.
When you do that, you put a name in this case, in this case.
If you don't, somebody can record.
I mean, it has a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 scheduled applications last year.
But it does something that no other government technology does.
And it spread in viral form.
A responsible of systems of the city of Honolulu in looking at this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to bring up the tsunami of tsunami.
It's very important that these kinds of tsunami work, but people were stealing the batteries.
So he asked citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to show up the pressure.
And Chicago just launched it to get people to record to clean sidewalks when new.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use.
And this has spread without friction, naturally and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know this doesn't happen normally.
The software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that required three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that to have done it by normal channels would have taken at least two years and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the California court of California, which until the moment has taken two million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days, and it's spreading in viral form, is a kind of a transplant to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best way to work, not like the private companies, as many people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, open and generative.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to tackle the government issue that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an analog institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just Code in America, but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contributed to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given by the government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't complain, they fix it.
And these people know something that we've lost from sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in Michael -- and all of those other things that put us crazy, the government is in the words of Tim Gollywood,``What we do together because we can't . ''
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to remember it, because things are changing.
Politics doesn't change; government itself.
And because the government ultimately demands from us -- remember that from``us, the village"? The way to think about it will affect the way that change change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government is to choose people to get married.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially, question of demographics.
This is the phone phone center of services and information.
It's the place that the calls of the calls, if you make 31 in the U.S.
Scott tried this call.
\" Commanian"in the base of official knowledge.
I didn't find anything . It started with animal control.
And finally he said,``Hey, you can open up the doors of the house, put good music and see if it goes? ''
And it worked, so well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the magnetic.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a app, web and mobile, called The Tentile University.
We don't program that app.
It was the very smart work of people in the New Nations Institute of Boston.
One day, this happened really, and it goes,``Check in my garbage cube . I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to remove it? ''
The dynamic of Tential Connecticut is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In Titanic Connecticut, it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said,``I approached the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
Miko? Yes . Life? Yes.
I turned the cube . I went home.
Good evening, sweet sleep . ''
Pretty simple.
This is great . It's the confluence of the digital and the physics.
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technology definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to educate and help others.
So, one citizen helped another, but here the government had a key role.
It connected the two people.
And I could have connected to the government services to be necessary, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we strengthen communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about government is that it's not the same as politics.
Many people understand it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader? Sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that government reflects our values and satisfy our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the superficial layer of 15 centimeters.
Underneath it is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that contempt that keeps us that that we finance as something that operates in our against, that other thing, and in consequence we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sensual.
If we want this institution to work we have to make agriculture sensual.
Because that's where the real government work happens.
We have to collaborate with the government machinery.
That makes the model movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of worried citizens who have written a very detailed report from 350 pages in response to the order of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism, it's bureaucratic activism.
And for those of us who have resigned to government, it's time that we ask ourselves what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really think we will get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in behalf of all?
We can't sell government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows that it's not so hard to act on it, you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The age of age of our members is 28 years old, so I, to crabs, I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk; everyone will talk.
You can express your opinions at any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face government's problem, they don't care much about making your voices.
They're using your hands.
They put the work together to program applications that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a hydrant, taking out weeds, dumping a garbage cube that has a negotiation inside.
And then, of course, we could always clean those hydrants and many people do it.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we are not only consumers, we are not only government consumers that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the citizenship.
So I want to ask all the speakers, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, will we be a voice crowd, or will we be a crowd crowd?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in jails, prisons and on death row.
I've spent most of my life in marginalized communities, in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimuli, I've given a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is really important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, if it's charitable, it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in practice of the right, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of an African-American family dominated by a matriarch, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She started a lot of the discussions in our home.
It was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia about 1848.
She was born about the 1880 and his experience with slavery, confirmed the way he looked at the world.
She was hard, but it was also loving.
When I was a little girl and I looked at it, she came up to me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then blow me up.
One or two hours later, he went back to him, and he came up to me and said,``Bring, do you feel my hug? ''
And if I told him that no, I grabbed again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that made you always want to be near it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the age of 10.
In occasions, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, I woke up one morning, I went into the room, and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
Then he looked at it and she smiles, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, grabbed my hand, and he said,``Come Google.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
And he took me outside and said,``Bring, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody . ''
I said,``Okay, Mom . ''
She said,``Now let's make sure you won't do it ."I said,``Sure . ''
And then I sat down, and he looked at me and said,``I want you to know I've been watching you . ''
And he said,``I think you're special.
He said,``I think you can do whatever you want . ''
I'll never forget it.
Then he said,``I just want you to promise me three things, Gwen.
I said,``Sure, Mom . ''
And he said,``The first thing I want you to promise is you always want your mother . ''
She said,``She's my daughter, and you have to promise me to always care.
As I would love my mom, I said,``Yes, Mom, I'll do it . ''
And then he said,``The second thing I want you to do is you'll always do the right thing, although the right thing is . ''
And I thought,``Yes, Mom . I'll do it . ''
Then finally he said,``the third thing I want you to do is you never drink alcohol.
I was nine years old, and I said,``Yes, Mom, I'll do it . ''
I grew up in the field, in the South rural . I have a older year and one sister a year.
When I was 14, a day my brother came home with a six beers, I didn't know where he took them, grabbed my sister and me and we went for the forest.
We just got to make the usual nuts.
He took a beer pot, offered my sister, and she took a little bit and offered me.
I said,``No, no, no . All right . You follow, but I'm not going to take beer . ''
My brother said,``Come on . Today you do it . And you always do the same thing as we do.
I've taken something, your sister too . Take a beer . ''
I said,``No . I won't feel good . You can follow . ''
Then my brother looked at me.
He said,``What happens? Take a beer.
I was looking at her with strength and continued,``Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with Mom . ''
I said,``But what are you talking about? ''
He said,``Mom tells all the grandchildren that are special.
I got rid.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread widely.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a virtue; I say it by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things that they really don't think of it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been rewarded during the ban.
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that, according to her, had to commit.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than what was 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In America, we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in probation.
And this massive incarceration, in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor or black communities, it's so dense, so much despair, determined by these facts.
One in three black black between 18 and 30 is in prison or in probation.
In urban communities across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the color young people are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that tries you much better if you're rich and guilty, that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not guilt, but it's wealth that's affected the results.
And it seems that we feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems.
We're disconnected.
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some very curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you're paid for rights forever if you have a criminal line.
Right now in Alabama , 34 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we projected it over the next 10 years, the loss of rights loss of rights will be as high as it was before they would pass the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where you feel about 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, no possibility to go out.
Right now we're in a process of some litigation.
The only country in the world.
I represent people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In some sense, have you taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve dying for committed crime?
A very sensitive question.
But you can think otherwise about how we are in our identity.
There's another way to look at it: it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the committed crimes, but if we deserve killing.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
Of every nine people executed, it has identified one that is innocent and liberated from the death row.
A waste rate, amazing, an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation, it wouldn't be allowed to be allowed if any of the nine that you would get away, you would have to star.
But somehow we isolate the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of if we deserve killing.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about African-American history, I'm talking about slavery.
I'm talking to you about terrorism, the time he started at the end of the reconstruction, and it lasted to the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid to be carbon.
They were worried to be bombarded.
The threat of terror was what his lives defined.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say,``Mr. Stevenson, you tell talks, make speeches . Tell the people who stop saying that in our history, we first started with terrorism, after 9/11 . ''
They ask me to say,``No . Say we grew up with that . ''
The era of terrorism continued, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we historically have done.
All the time we collide with each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflicts.
It costs us work to talk about race . I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial segregation without a commitment with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country, we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said,``You know it's good worrying to listen what you say . ''
He said,``we don't have death death in Germany.
We could never be able to have it here . ''
The room stayed in silence and a lady said,``There is no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, intentional and deliberately, we were going to run people . ''
So let's think about this.
How would we feel like a nation like Germany, running people, especially if they were mostly Jews?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnect.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these very difficult issues, positive and wonderful things are, however, involved.
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology . We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are recorded by suffering, abuse, degradation, marginalized.
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
We're very much talking about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the shots, the ones that will never get to TED.
Think about them, in a way, something that's inside of us.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual.
With innovation, with creativity, development comes not just brain ideas.
These things come from ideas also fueled by heart convictions.
This connection of the mind with heart is what drives us to look at not just in the bright and distracted, but also the dark and the hard.
Maria Hello, the great boy leader, talked about this.
He said,``When we were in East Europe suffering the oppression, we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in places of despair and witness.
Well, that orientation for the spirit is basically in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, has to commit.
There's no relationship to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to exclusion, to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We went back to them.
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer, to meet Rosa Parks.
These women are meeting just to speak.
Occasionally, Mr. Jarrett called me, to say,``Bring, you come the lady's lady . We're going to meet to talk.
Do you want to come and listen to us? ''
I said,``Yes, ma'am . I want . ''
So she said,``Well, what do you do when you come?
I said,``Listen . ''
So I was going and just listen to them.
It was a very very self-destructive thing.
And in one occasion I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said,``Now, Gwen, tell me that it's that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do . ''
And I started giving my speech.
I said,``Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been wrongfully convicted.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We're trying to end up with the feelings of life, without medical freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty.
We try to reduce population population.
We try to end up with massive incarceration . ''
I gave her all my best speech, and when he finished me, he looked at me and said,``Mmm jellyfish . ''
And he added,``you end, very exhausted.
At that time, Mrs. Face's leaned, he put the finger on the face and said,``That's why you have to be very, very brave . ''
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We need to figure out how to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst we've made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not that it's a thief.
Even if someone kills another, it's not that it's a murderer.
So I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be respected by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country, and certainly, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very industrial, very stimulating, we won't judge ourselves for our technology, for our designs, not by our intellectual or rational capacity.
At the end you judge the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich, powerful and privileged, but by the way they treat poor, condemned, prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel published . I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I'm tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been sentenced with a lot of poverty.
I go to jail and I see my 13-year-old clients and 14, who have been habitats to be judged for adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what isn't?
And the judge was held as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night was awake thinking -- by God, if the judge can turn you into something you're not, it must have magical powers.
Yes, Gwen, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a emotion.
He had a 14-year-old client, a small, poor, black.
I started working on the excitement, with a reference that said,``Voice for my 14-year-old black client is treated as a 75-year-old privilege, executive of a corporation . ''
In the emotion, I learned that there had been a behavior in the accusation, the behavior behavior and in the process.
There was a very bold line on how in this country in this country, there's no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that teaching emotion would be a dream, or actually writing it?
For my horror, not only had it turned it down, but I had sent it to the court.
They spent about two months, I had already forgotten it.
And I finally decided -- Oh God, I have to go to court for this stupid case.
I went to the car and I felt really overwhelmed, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to the judge.
I thought this would be very difficult and beautiful.
I finally got off the car . I walked to the court.
I was climbing the stairs when I met a bigger black man; it was the hacker of the judge.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said,``Who is you? ''
I said,``I'm a lawyer ."He said,``Are you lawyer?"I said yes.
So I got stuck and hug.
And I'm whispering in the ear.
He said,``I'm proud of you . ''
I have to tell you now that that was visualized.
That became deeply connected with my inner identity, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audience room.
When I went into, the judge saw me.
He said,``Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this heavy emotion?
I said,``Yeah Mr. I was me ."And we started discussing.
People started coming . They were all outraged.
I was the one who had written those crazy.
They arrived the police prosecutors, the auxiliary.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, all furious because we talked about race, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the drawing of the eye, he got to see the concierge that went and came.
I looked at the window, and I was able to hear all that little clip.
I kept walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black, with face face, entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge decided a bug.
During the rest of a student from the student, he showed up because the counselor had entered the room.
The assistant was speaking on the old black.
And he said,``Jimmy, what do you do in the audience room? ''
And the old black stood up, looked at the assistant, looked at me and said,``I walked into this audience room to tell this young man who keep his view in the firm target . ''
I've come to TED because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds into justice.
That we can't be truly evolved if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is attached to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be used to the feasibility, compassion and justice.
And on top of all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the objective target.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and see an obvious desire of the audience, from this community, to help in your purposes, to do something.
Something that's not a check . What can we do?
AS: There are several close opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a referendum in which you're going to make a effort to recreate the funds that are spent today in punishment policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on the death penalty, in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this , 46 percent of the cases of homicide don't fit in arrest.
56 percent of rapes don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This referendum is going to propose that these funds are going to take care of law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been huge decline in crime in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the highest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those who believe it's like this?
AS: Actually, the rate of crime crime has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass incarceration in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's by the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase emerges in the prison population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric rhetoric.
We have three legal causes to bring people to a perpetual chain; for stealing a bicycle, by small crimes against property, instead of making those resources back to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Bring, you've been excited here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having TED . Thank you.

Peter Diamandis: These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, and it could be just from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that press means prefer to give us negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
Every second in every single day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can process.
And as nothing matters to survive, the first stop of all that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called amygdala.
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the danger detector.
He ordered and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could make damage.
So of a dozen stories, we would rather look at the negatives.
That old adage of the press:``if there's blood, sell, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days in the week , 24 hours a day, not surprising that we're pessimistic.
It's not surprising that people think that the world is wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe what really happens is that we get designers.
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, species extinction, water scarcity and energy; we certainly have them.
As human beings, we're really good at analyzing the problems, and in the long, we end up with them.
We looked at it in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, average life has been more than doubled, average income per capita adjusted by inflation has tripled around the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kennedy that the world literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
Many people forget.
And we continue to put more and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, bathrooms, refrigerators, mobile phones, air, air, air.
The massive boats of the car last century, the emperor of the planet, would never have dreamed of such a luxury.
Support a lot of this is technology, and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that contains in information technology in this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the cell phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law over the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First of all, how soft it is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and in the rise.
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's rooted on a law on the left, it gets curved up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And in this curve, in the Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we count today.
The computation in the cloud, which my Autodesk friends call infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics , 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and the food, the digital medicine, the humanities and the AI.
I mean, how many saw the victory in Florida from Watson?
It was epic.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline.
And I loved this:``Watson comes to human opponents.
Jeopardy is not a easy game.
It plays with the mathematics of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, launched a new university called Singularity University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to lead a company, or a product or service, which can be affecting the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have sounded absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating fancy life for every single person on the planet; it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that, which is scarce and to become plentiful.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Nobel III in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited the king of Bassem.
The troops of Napoleon ate with silver covers, and the same Napoleon, with gold covers.
But the king of Bassem, I ate with aluminum covers.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet; it's worth more than gold and dish.
That's why the tip of Mount to Washington is aluminum.
You see, although the aluminum is eight percent of the Earth's mass, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's bound by oxygen and silent.
But then the electronics came and made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as being downloaded.
We project this analogy towards the future.
Think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet where we're in a middle for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to Earth 16 hours of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scarcity, it's about accessibility.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the one of the generated by diesel : 88,000 rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity cost six cents per hour per hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have energy abundance, we also have water abundance.
Let's talk about water wars.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed the Voyager spacecraft on the Earth, in 1990, after happened Saturn?
He took a famous picture . What was it called?
\" A pale dot blue . ''
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent per water.
Yes , 97 percent is saltwater, two percent ice is ice, and we fight for the 0.5 percent of the water on the planet, but there is also a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the animals.
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the broccoli -- I'd like to share with you, I gave you permission to do that -- his technology called System probably already is the size of a small refrigerator.
It's able to generate 1,000 gallons of drinking water on the day of any source water salt, contaminated water, a latrine for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just agreed to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have a full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it globally in 26 countries on the planet.
This is an innovation powered by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of information abundance and communications that nobody could have predicted.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars, of Congressional video, video, images, medical diagnoses and music, medical diagnosis technology now spill and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best comes in when the applications of health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with the Drug Foundation something called the X March Michael Michael , 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the teams in the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk about, and because it's AI, you can sew, you can get blood from the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the disease charge is 25 percent, and there are 1.3 percent health workers.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that doesn't recognize, calling the health care and, first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion.
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the brand of the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to cost the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion internet users.
Three billion minds never before they add to the global conversation.
What do these people want?
What do you consume? What do you wish?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And they will spend more health, because of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D printing and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more of humanity, healthy and productive healthy health?
How about a voices never before?
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and being able to act for the first time?
What will these three billion will do?
And if they're contributions that we can't predict?
One thing I learned with the X X is that small teams, guided by their passion with a clear goal, can do extraordinary things -- things that were previously only able to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end by sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called Fortune.
He came up at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of supercomputers.
They've played with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started playing it.
And it's shown that today the recognition of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to assume the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the individual prisoner.
We have the capital capital.
And we have three billion new minds that will be used to work in the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea.
It's the rate of the point of departure.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1884.
Maybe they believed that I was a little pension, but it didn't.
It's actually collecting fish.
And I described one of them as very``common . ''
It was the groupers.
You've got a lot of fish to the decade of 1880.
Now the fish is at the Red List of the IUCN.
But we heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're pristine.
The brochures still say they follow intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: the shifting of the waist.
Because I was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate.
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by palm, and as you can see, of some mangroves.
There were about 20 inches, the black beard barrier.
And the fishing of this bee was very abundant and passed for a good moment, so it was made more than the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had halved half.
They're ripe at five inches.
They experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of the cave fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, well, it started in the 1960s, made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was supposed to impose countries that already had 100,000 fishermen, imposing industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite ugly, was called the Mandel 4.
I went out to fishing on it, and we did studies in the South China Sea, and especially in the Sea Sea.
What we captured there was something invisible.
We captured, now I know, sea bottom.
Ninety percent of what we captured were sponges, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny blobs about a few remains, remains that are fish reef fish.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck, and then it was thrown down.
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study, and then you start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid fund of soft coral, in this case, to be a powder.
This is a dead turtle.
They didn't eat them . They stopped because they were dead.
Once we captured a living.
I was still not drowning.
So they wanted to kill it because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time you go to a zone where they have never fished.
But I don't have documented.
We transformed the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of departure, to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you generalize this, something like this happens.
In the y-axis, we have good things: biodiversity, a number of gold, the vegetables of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time . It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images of their conscious life as normal and how to extrapolate it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the change of change.
And at the end of the end of keeping some remains.
And that, in large measure, is we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when predators kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal which is very abundant, before extinct, is little frequent.
You don't lose plentiful animals.
You lose little frequencies.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the large animals, and in a sea of big fish.
They become little prevalent because we caught them.
And over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of departure.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, questions that it was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you present, like they captain such and so many fish in this area can't be used or usually not using fish scientists, because it's not``scientist . ''
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in built societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
Hence the enormous role that can be able to have a protected marine area.
Because with the protected marine areas, we actually recreated the past.
We recreated the past that people can't conceive because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for people who can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that provides, which allows them to erase their baseline.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there are arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum . The simulation.
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay; 500 years ago.
And you've noticed that mathematicians and skills are like``Avatar . ''
And if you think about``Avatar ,"if you think why people are moving with the movie, I don't talk about the story of males why to move with the images?
Because it evoke something that, in a sense, has lost.
So my recommendation, the only one to give, is Cameron, make``Avatar II"underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi . I'm Kevin Cocolage, the government of YouTube trends, and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we'll see why video games do viral and how important it has.
We all want to be stars: celebrities, singers, comedians -- when I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a room.
Over 48 hours of video video to YouTube per minute.
And, of course, just a small percentage gets viral, it gets infinite from visit and wins culture.
How does that happen?
Three things: trends of trends, participation communities and surprise factors.
Well, let's start.
Bernard mirrors: Oh my God, God.
Oh my God!
Wow!
Humor, wow!!!
KA: Last year, Mr. Schell published this video outside his house in the National Park of Yosemite.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproduction in the popularity of the past summer last summer.
Berid doesn't make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Yosemite Mountain Bernard.
I had already published a lot of videos from nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kimmel.
Jimmy Kimmel published this tweet that would compute the video to popularity.
The creators like Jimmy Kimmel are presented to us new new and interesting things and spread them into a wider audience.
Rebecca Black: It's Friday, Friday . You've got to start Friday . Everybody wants the weekend, the weekend . Friday, Friday.
\" Friday"from Rebecca Black is one of the most popular videos in the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like,``rainbow double double ,"this video seemed to have arisen from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other peaks, they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday?
Well, it took Joseph and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson, from Nigeria Sercirilly Theater, was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter video.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends of trends embrace a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this great joke, then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 clips in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other day.
Unlike the technological entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon spreading or doing something new with that.
\" Ken Cat"is a repetitive animation with a music chord.
That's what it is.
This year, they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a three hours version that's seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that I woke up between the Internet's Internet community.
There was remix.
Somebody did a version of the ancient.
And then international.
Suddenly, the whole community of remix that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form part of.
Because today we're not just enjoying, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted```` Diabet Diameter double ,"or Rebecca Black or``National Cat? ''
What could you mean, could you have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video come up by a minute, only that really unique and unexpected can be stuck in the way that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who was protest against the protests in New York City, I admit that I didn't care too much.
Casey Street: I was fired by not circular because of the glass, but there are often obstacles that are preventing you directly by the chain.
KA: Thank you.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we do in creative ways.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
Bein mirrors: What does this mean?
Humor.
KA: What does this mean?
The trends of trends, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, of a new culture, that we all have access and the audience that defines popularity.
As I said before, one of the world's celebrities, Justin Bieber, started in YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, they're just the media of the current media, but they will define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that's still being crushed.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece: a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
Imagine it as the communist comes in in Switzerland, facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long friends, now they were broken.
He refugee in silence.
He died by history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that happen in vain, and my lesson was to learn that history tried to scare us, but let's support it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of melting silence into the sea.
My mother, Mac, was only 18 years old when his father died, and a connected marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a task alone: the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a four-year-old sauce that defies the fiction, a boat went down to the disguised sea of fishing ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was pirate, rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a jar with poison.
If you caught us, first we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the test brown into each wave, and the vast horizon and empty.
I didn't remember the pirate dogs who came several times, but they were fooled with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to run for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given for the men of the platform.
No apple had the same taste.
After three months in a refugee camp, we went down in Melbourne.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in Protoscape, a world-class suburb, whose population is comprised of immigrants.
Unlike the middle-class suburbs, whose existence I knew, in Project, had no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the shops were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English were exchanging between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT.
We were poor.
All of the dollars were assigned, and he established an extra tutor in English and mathematics, no matter what you should take away, which was generally new clothes; it was always a second hand.
Two pairs of media for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the ankles, because I had to last six years.
And there were weird and painful singing, and some graffiti:``Asia, come home . ''
So home, where?
Something in me gets hardened.
I was accumulating determination and a voice saying,``I'm going to miss them.
My mother, sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was exhausted every night, but we were telling us about our day and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered nightmares, all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to wake it up.
She opened a computer shop, then studied to be a statistician and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and flexible, and armed boys trapped between two worlds.
They were looking for subsidies and sponsors.
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student, impossible with what I was from myself.
In the other, I was steeped in the lives of life, tragically hurt for violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people received help over the years.
And because of that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer, I was elected by young Australian young.
And I went from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
So read, Minute anonymous from StoryCorps, was now so Lee, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in sites that I had never heard, and in houses whose existence she'd never imagined.
I didn't know the protocols.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat the routine and the comfort of life in a wild suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling about the day of each one and throwing asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when we got down the boat.
The``No"had never been an option.
\" Make it ,"he said,``and you're not what you don't know.
So I talked about youth and education and destiny to marginalized and strategies.
And the more frankly I talked, the more I was applied to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they loved, living in the border of possible.
And although I finished my bachelor, I realized I couldn't stay in a career race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly arrived, new one in the scene -- and not just that it's okay, but it's something that's grateful, maybe a ship ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean collapsing the horizons, it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your province.
I gave enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world fell apart, but not the way we fear.
It wouldn't have been allowed to have been allowed tremendously.
There was an energy there, an amazing optimism, a rare mixture of humility and bravery.
So I followed my intuition.
I joined a small group of people for who the motto``can't do"was an irresistible challenge.
For a year, we didn't have a penny.
At the end of every day, he made a giant soup of soup that we all share.
We worked until the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single trip.
My hunch again.
Three months later, I had moved, and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when confusion was social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised it alone.
At 17, he became a realization of a Mandarin whose mother was beaten.
Without support of his husband, he caused a refrigerator when it took it and take the cause herself, and much more recently, when he won.
He can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in Sydney when she died , 3,000 miles, in Melbourne.
I looked through the knee of the shower, and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to get fired.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Protoscriptions and sat around their casket.
We tell them stories, and we make sure we were still with her.
At night a monk came and told us he had to close the tuna.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monk,``Why is your hand warm, and the rest of the body so cold? ''
\" Because you have taken your hand from the morning ,"he said.
\" They haven't solved it . ''
If there is a nerve in our family, that run through women.
Since who we were and how life formed us, now we can see that men who had come to our lives would have frustrated us.
The defeat would have done easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I ask myself about the boat.
Who could want that to do that?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a test in their lives, brown into each wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, I would do it.
Green Nickles and also mother's mother here today, in the fourth or fifth rows.
My story starts in Rajasthan about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the starly sky, with the Sufi Mandela Martin singer.
We were talking about how nothing has changed from the time of the old Indian newspaper.
In those days, when the Indians wanted to travel to a car, we were running the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when June, the big Indian warrior Indian, he was thirsty, he took a bow and with a stroke to the floor, he got water.
Now we do the same with toilets and machines.
The conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that was very sad to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more.
I was terrified this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't tweet my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not killing it.
As a kid, my grandfather gave me his freeze silver.
And this 100 year-old technology was for me the most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images and pirates and branches in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, luxury clocks and cameras prevent that we dream.
They provide our inspiration.
So I launched, I threw up this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of killing it.
It was books since age 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Bring the text together with the image, animation, sound and touch.
storytelling gets more and more self-assembly.
But what does that serve us?
I'm about to launch Kipi, an interactive app for iPad.
He says,``Put your fingers on every light.
And so, he says,``This box belongs to ..."I write my name.
And so I become a book character.
In several times I get a letter -- the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child is excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magician and dragons, but to that magic magic, to those ideas that we opened of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned me exciting.
So, over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they lit your way into what you see from the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a child was that a whole galaxy wants in a pocket.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a collapse that I dragged into this magical device, inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there has always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows, infrastructure and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also revealed.
Now I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary.
These are the barriers.
We've all heard of the fairies and the grandchildren, but how many people outside India know their Indian counterparts, would you get them out?
These poor developments have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in a old and humid book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary child.
In a story that deals today like the environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked down, glued to their PCs, have not come out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections -- of clubs, paintings, worms and shells.
For some reason, kids don't.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual, you have to go out and, in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then tag it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then tag it.
So you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child from London puts a picture of a fox and says,``Oh, I saw a fox.
A child in India says,``I saw a monkey.
And this kind of social network is created around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking . .
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we're trying to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video switched on and through augmented reality, you see a group of swollen strings that appear on the inside plants of the house.
The screen is full of leaves.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and blow them up so you can read the rest of the book.
Let's go into a world where nature forces are intertwined with technology and magic and technology to come up with each other.
We leverage the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many studies of bone fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stopped listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at University University was to give a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and acquaintances: What happens? ''
How can we help it?
And we tend to think, this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not all, but most of the Buddhist projects fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my little Wi-Fi loop . It's very simple.
It has a light bulb.
Every morning goes up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 kilograms.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect, I send my information to Google Health.
And my head doctor has access to it too . So, he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when it needs cardiac assistance or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I'm connected to my little Wi-Fi loop, and before I go up to my car, people start talking to me,``Look, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be employed to move people from their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From next week, it will be available.
This little carbon connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send it to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they go back to recover control and being captains of their own boat, but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of medicine care, demand demand and other issues.
It's going to make techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also through discovery.
And one of the things we did would like to share with you with a video.
We all have navigation controls in cars.
Maybe even we have them in our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are in Frustan.
So where all the gas is.
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest breakfast to help this patient?
We asked but no one knew.
No one knew where to get the NSA in this moment.
What we did was we made it disappointed in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public that: If you see a NSA, please send it, decide where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 Euros already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created a application for protocell, augmented reality, to find these Edison.
And every time they're in the city of Microsoft and someone collapses, you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks, they use their cell phone to find the closest Donon, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like Dean 40, which is the name of the product, but also as 2014.
And we want to start it globally.
We're driving all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the destruction of the Stonewall around the world.
Every time they're vacation and someone collapses, it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us to value these Edison.
They could be messaging services or telephone people, for example, to see if the NSA that shows is still in place.
Please, forgive us in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it the photography?
Because, of course, they're photographs that you can't take their cameras.
My interest for photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15.
It was mixed with my passion before the drawing, but it was a little different because when I used the camera, the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when you press the pulsing.
To me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
I felt like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the pulsing.
Formals like this: a construction in a very straight road.
But it has an unexpected twist.
And despite it, it keeps a level of realism.
Or pictures like this -- dark and colorful at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of realism.
And when I say realism I say that momentum.
Because of course, it's not something that can capture, but I always want it to seem to have been captured somehow as photography.
The photos you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more to do with capturing an idea than to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?
Are the details or colors?
Does light intervene?
What does the illusion create?
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about how we interpret the world and how you can perceive on a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic, but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly imaginable objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way can create something that still seems three-dimensional; as if it exists.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, let's get to the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining photographs.
It really is to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic, I think they're the ones that we don't even think, the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs, it's very important to consider it, because otherwise something will look bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, they can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, combined photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images were turned to these requirements; they were taken to the same height and with the same type of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect union.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is made.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is manipulated.
But this picture is totally composed by photographs of different places.
In the personal I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The costs are from a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a rock stone.
And yes, I even did red the house of the top of the island so that it seems more Sweden.
So to make a realistic result, I think it makes planning.
It's always starting with a sketch, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well thought of.
If you do a good job when you take the photos, the result can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there, and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it.
It's a diagram anybody I took from a folder.
I'm not so interested in showing you the details, but the general aspect.
It's a analysis that we were doing about the power of RISD processor versus the power of local areas.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many others we tend to see, is a kind of straight line in logarithmic scale.
In other words, each step from here represents a order of magnitude on the performance scale.
Speaking technology with logarithmic curves is something novel.
Here's something weird.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please understand the lights.
It would need more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we plot technological curves on logarithmic scales?
The answer is that if I draw them in a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to plot, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you plot, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a logarithmic curve would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like that, you give a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology advanced as fast as the microprocessors, we could tomorrow take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't move forward.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a feedback that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to plan is -- looking at these exponential curves, we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It's going to happen one of two things.
Or it's going to be a typical curve, I know like this until it sounds completely different, or maybe doing something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like that.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask, is, what is that new way that embraces the world?
What new state does the world spread?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember that the future happened in 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has shrunk, year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all so different than extrapolate what we're doing today has no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that transition that we experience.
But to do that, I'll have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back about 250 million years when the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals floating around it.
If we look at the way that chemicals were organized, we give a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA, and I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, I had floating some oil droplet with all sorts of chemical prescriptions inside.
Some of those oil droplet contain a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so on.
And they started to divide.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms; those oil droplet.
But those blobs were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a prescription of chemicals.
And every time they were dividing a distribution of the chemicals that they contain.
So each logistics was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow became better at the time of incorporating chemicals, they grew up more, they make more chemicals and they divide more.
They were usually living longer, they were more represented.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things became interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways that we didn't understand very well these droplets learned how to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, they worked in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to replicate.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since they evolved 250 million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, each living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by fun -- we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 white dust molecules that try to hide people of security security.
But it contains -- I took this code -- the code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this DNA fragments and I amplified 10 to 22 times.
So if anyone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have many for all the present -- in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a hole, I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it out of the room.
What was the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy for another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different, and that was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, they evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and pass them up to create their small DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and they set a synergy.
In that way, they survived or failed together, or whether a community was very successful, all the individuals in that community became more and they were overlooked by evolution.
And the point of inflection occurred when these communities came up so much that they came together and decided to write the entire recipe of the community together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have multicellular communities, communities of many different kinds of cells working together like one organism.
In fact, we are a multicellular community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve the heart, or the one of the muscles, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
They started to bring information.
And to build very special structures that were not making more special than processing information in community.
It's neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to record, understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not the time period of evolutionary time.
So, an organism could, for example, learn how to eat a little bit of fruit because he knew bad, and she got sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism since they had built these information processing structures that have been learned by evolution for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that nervous system will build those information structures enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So, for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If you think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea a vague idea, in the head.
I'm here sitting here holding a few degrees, and hopefully building a similar, vague idea, in your heads that keeps a certain analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as an organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
Now we go through periods like multicellular organisms; we abstract our record methods, presentation and information processing.
For example, language invention was a little step in that direction.
The telephone, computing, video tape, the DNA and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that makes us much bigger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary model of Eden where he produced some evolution with the solution program, before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story that told them took a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The next, language, took less than a million years.
And the next, like electronics, looks just a few decades.
The process is feedback; I assume that automatic is the right word to name something that connects its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is feedback.
But I was making my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms I work to design would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now I design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to design them in a conventional way.
I don't know that it does every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of the Microposaursis Michelandure, we think about an abstraction level, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn't do before, much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method, which I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random instruction sequence.
We say,``computer, can you run a hundred million sequences of random instructions?
Could you run these instructions from random instructions, run all those programs, and take those who are more approaching what we want to do? ''
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random random sequences, order numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, could put two numbers in the right order.
And I said,``computer, could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task? ''
Let's take those and we eliminate the rest.
And now we reproduce the ones that best ordered numbers.
And we go back to play them by following a process of reaction for sex . ''
Let's take two programs, who will ignore children, who exchange supermarkets, and that kids inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of software programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say,``Please repeat the process . ''
Wow again.
It introduced some mutations.
And I try again and play with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or, in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that lead numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're dark programs, strangers.
But they take the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the safety that you get the goal because they come from a lineage of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depended on doing it.
I once went in a 747 with Martin File, and he pulled up a card and says,``Look at this.
He says,``This airplane has hundreds of thousands of participants working together to offer a safe flight .' not makes you feel quiet? ''
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make design processes very different.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the entire choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster, and so we can run these programs much faster.
So it's feedback.
The thing goes faster and faster, and so I think it seems so confused.
Because all of these technologies are broken.
We're getting off.
And we're at a moment of analog organisms when they became multicellular.
We're the amoeba, and we can't understand what the hell we are creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes from.
But now comes the lunch, and I think to stop here before I'm eliminated.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've touched enough time to allow me to get part of my false printing on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Series.
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
He's going to go out,``Petrified the rules"-- talks about statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called a battery average.
And we're talking about 300, from a bat that batteries 300.
That means that the fuel fuel efficiency, three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game field without being caught, and anyone who tries to launch it to the first base, not come in time, and the second foundation will be saved.
Three tries of 10.
You know how to call a 300 contractor of 300 in the Great League?
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball baseball?
By the way, that's somebody who's 10 hits, four.
So, protein -- like Ted Williams, the last player of the largest League League player to execute more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's take this into my medical world where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
They assume that they have an indication, and they're derived to a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in applications.
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place, and a loved self has two board arteries, and their family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record in anti-making is 200.
But do you know something?
She's actually improving this year.
And their concerts have been 250.
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you think about to be the average stock of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon, or a nurse or a secret system?
A thousand, very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in medicine knows the actions of a good surgeon, a doctor or a mate.
What we do, though, is to send the world, and I include myself, with the mandate of being perfect.
That never, ever, make a mistake and thinking about figuring out how to do it right.
That was the message I absorb when I was in medical school.
I was a computer capitalist student.
Once, a fellow in the high school said that Brian Goldman studied to a blood test.
That's what.
I studied in my little street, at the residence of General General Hospital nurses, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the air, the diagnosis, the diagnosing difference and the usual.
And I even knew the diagnosis difference about how to classify the kidney condition.
And the more I used more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with honor.
And I came from school school with the impression that if I memorized everything, then it would know everything, or the most possible, close to the whole, because so I'm encouraged from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. Professor.
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the Russian lady to emergency service where I worked.
At the time, they assigned me to the cardiology service.
And when you go out, I applied to a cardiologist to attend to that patient.
It's going to inform the chief of residents.
When I saw Mr. President, I was broken.
I heard a coherent sound.
And when I put it, I heard a sound sound on both sides, which was a cognitive heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pumping the blood forward, blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's hard to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose.
I did it, and I started working on the treatment that would give him.
I gave him anti-degree and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
He gave them fun, water pills, so that he could eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I bought the first mistake; he sent her home.
Actually, I made two mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't raise the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and consult him to see it.
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to provide complementary information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to require constant attention.
I might want to be so successful and able to take responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without even contact to contact my boss.
The second mistake I ate was worse.
By sending her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my interior who said,``Goldman, it's not a good idea . Don't do it . ''
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse to take care of the lady President,``Do you think it's okay if you go home? ''
And the nurse thought, and then he said,``Yes, I think it will be okay . ''
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So I signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the paradigms took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, packed to leave the hospital and walked into the parking room where my car was to go home . At that time I did something I don't normally.
I went through the emergency service service.
And there another nurse, not the one who was taking care of the terrifying lady before, but another one . He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency physicians fear.
Other specialists also fear it too, but there's a particular one, and we see the patient's patients.
The three words are: Do you remember?
\" Do you remember the patient who sent home? ''
I asked another nurse with total nature.
\" Well she came back ,"with the same voice tone.
She was good.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
Within an hour of having arrived at home, after I gave her high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 -- the ambulance brought them to emergency with a 40-year-old blood pressure, which means a severe shock.
I was barely breathing and blue.
The emergency staff is hanging up all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise the blood pressure.
He had an artificial breathing.
I was shocked and rocked up to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings, because after the stabilize was in intensive therapy and hoped against all hope that would recover.
And in the two or three days, it was obvious that I would never wake up.
He had a irreversible brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they refused to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let him go . Mrs. Rockett, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they're never forgotten the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next weeks, I was punished by that, and I experienced for the first time the bad shame that exists in our medical culture and sat alone, isolated, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make peace and never more committed that error.
It's that shame that leaves an teaching.
The bad shame that I talk about is the one that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not what we did was bad, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't my boss; he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I was dreaming of things and make sure that they wouldn't demand me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my boss? Why did I send it home?
And in my worst moments, why did I make a silly mistake?
Why did I choose medicine?
Little, maybe that feeling was dissipate.
And I started feeling better.
And in a cloudy day, the sky opened, and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I was forced the efforts to be perfect not to make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And so it was.
I went back to work.
But it happened.
Two years later, I was advanced in the emergency department in a community hospital to Northern Toronto, and I got a 20-year-old man with a pain pain.
I was very busy.
And he was pointing here.
I watched his throat, I was a little bit colorful.
He wrote penicillin and sent it home.
But while he ran to the door, he kept her throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my guard change, my boss asked me to speak in her office.
And I gave the three words: Do you remember?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the throat?
Well he came back and he didn't have a static photographer.
It had a potentially deadly condition called physician.
You can look at Google . It's an infection, not the throat, but from the air air, and it can cause the close of those pathways.
He, fortunately, didn't fail.
It's called antibiotics, and it recovered at a few days.
And you go through the same period of shame and rap, then I encouraged me and went back to work, until it happened again and again, again.
Two times in the same turn of urgency, it didn't diagnose indicate.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it's 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a discovery.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
They ordered a dinosaur of kidneys, but it turned out normal . A colleague who was checking the patient perceived a certain sensitivity in the lower right, and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read it liquid to return and asked my colleague to check it.
You reviewed it, and when you noticed some sensitivity in the lower right, he called the surgeon.
They were both operated and recovered well.
But every case, I was drawn to myself.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a period.
The most significant ones have been over the last five years.
Only, embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that I'm really going to say, how can I share this with my colleagues?
How do I teach them this to don't make the same mistakes?
If I would go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, in a party, you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't listen to somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a programming in my hospital broke the wrong leg, believe me would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of errors.
It's the system in which there are two positions: the ones who make mistakes and the ones who can't sleep and the ones who have a little bit of results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we take from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will stay a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of spread and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical doctors and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article I wrote for the Sahara Star to my program:``White School, Black Art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous.
We work in a system where errors are happening every day, where one in 10 prescription drugs in the hospital are wrong, or disconnect is not right . In a system where the hospitals are increasingly more and more numerous, causing chaos and death.
In this country , 24,000 Canadian households die for preventable medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's all about crude underestimate, because we're not destroying the problem as we should.
And so they're things.
A hospital system where knowledge is multiplied every two or three years, and we don't care.
The deprivation of sleep invaded everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with pain pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes crazy with tears, and with breath to alcohol, and all of a sudden, my story is about contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot; I don't do things always.
And my patients are not cars . They don't relate their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals to error, well, not left anybody.
And what do people don't want to talk about their most serious cases?
In my program,``white Pennice, black art ,"is already a habit to say,``this is my worst mistake ."I would tell you all, from the ambulance to the head of heart surgery,```` This is my worst mistake ,"blah, blah, blah --``What are your mistakes?"And it would lead the
And their students stopped, they would go back, they would go down the head and they would cheat saliva and they started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They want to be able to say,``Look, don't commit the same mistake . ''
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a software medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The redefining doctor is human, you know human, it accepted it, and it doesn't get rid of their mistakes, but it's effort to learn from what's happened to teach others.
It shares their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It points out the mistakes of other people, not with the intention of catching them, but in a remote, supportive way for everybody to benefit.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings lead the system, and when this happens, they commit mistakes every time.
My name is Brian McDonald.
I'm a redefined doctor.
I'm human, I made mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I'm really excited about learning something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions take one day?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey to over 2,000 people, and the average number of choices that says to choose a middle American, is about 70 a day.
Not long ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of entrepreneurs.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives, and the time they used to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, they commit 130 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of decisions.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
You know how many they belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the hour?
How does the way that drives those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of today: choosing to the option of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, I'm blind, raise your hand alone if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive for you to give a palm.
And now my first question of day: Are you ready to hear about the problem of choice overload?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, I had this very, very high level supermarket -- at least at that time, it was very sophisticated.
It's called Sergio's.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There was about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar, more than 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 bottled water, and this was when we were taking water from the faucet.
I loved to go to that store, but in one occasion, I asked myself, why would I never buy anything?
This is the wind oil shelf.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in sealed box that came out of military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager, and I asked him,``Does this strategy to offer all these options? ''
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the metals . This is the one.
Plan.
They had 340 different classes.
We installed a post to taste, just to the entrance of the store.
We put them out of six flavors, or 24 different flavors, and we looked at two things: First, what do people have been willing to stop trying to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and try to try and
More people stopped when there were 24 -- 60 percent, that when there were only six , 40 percent.
We also looked at what they were more likely to buy a supermarket.
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy a lot.
Of the ones that stopped when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought metal.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy a message if they found six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy memory probably it's us, -- -- -- -- it's good to conserve the line, but it turns out that the problem of options' overload affects us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even when this doesn't take us.
Now the theme of the day: financial savings.
I'm going to describe this one study that I did with guru Guinea, Fedical Fensivi and Wei Jane, where we looked at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings for retirement savings, the program 401, encouraged people to save for the future.
And we found that actually there was a correlation.
We had 757 plans that were going from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds offered, the less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as you would like.
And in the plans that they offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation dropped down to 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So, for those who decided to participate, the bigger the options, the more people were inclined for avoiding actions or investment funds.
As soon as I had more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we would recommend to optimize the future financial well-being.
Over the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that they make the decision, that they apply it even when this goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions, in finance and health.
They're more likely to choose less satisfying things, even though it targets them better.
The main reason is that we use that giant variety of mass, mustard, vinegar and message, but we're not able to do the calculations to compare, contrast and choose from that amazing exhibition.
Today I want to introduce you four simple techniques that we've shown, in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, cutting.
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is more.
People always bother when I say,``cutting.
They worry about losing space on the screen.
But in fact, what we're seeing increasingly is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of weird waste options, there will be a rise in sales, you'll lower the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When I read``Process & Gamble"went from 26 different types of Head and Hollywood to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Corporation Goldman Corporation eliminated the products for cats of cats that are less sold, the uses in 87 percent, for two causes: greater sales and lower costs.
You know, the supermarkets of today, in average offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, it's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is Adam and offers only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato tomato.
In the world of financial savings, I think that one of the best examples that have emerged on how to handle the choices is the plant of David Foundation, the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are accepted automatically to a insurance fund.
They really want to choose, they're offered 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, often people say,``I don't know how to cut.
They're all important options . ''
The first thing I do is ask the employees,``Tell me the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't tell you, you can't do your customers . ''
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to Gary.
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience, a vacation with everything paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a description.
I want the read.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to read it, and then I want you to give an applause if you're ready to take the fortune of Gary.
( Little applause) Okay . Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
Aren't you more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that journey?
I think I actually have to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round, which in the second, but I can encourage and say that the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of options.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences should be very severe, very concrete.
Why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit or credit cards, which when they use effective?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with South Barbara and Grand prevention, about NGO from NGO who worked in NGOs . These people were in a meeting where they were being transferred to a 401 plan.
At that meeting, we had exactly how it was used, we did a little addiction.
What we added was that we requested the staff that would think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save more money.
So with this dynamic, there was an increase in the hobbies of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings, four percent.
The third technique is Coca-Cola.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hall.
We saw that in the supermarkets Gentleman is throughout the northeast of the northeast, the magazine exhibition can contain from 33 different types to 2034.
But, you know?
Because classification tells me how to differentiate them.
These are two jewelry exhibitions.
One is called``jazz"and the other,``Suancie . ''
If you think the one on the left is Six, and the one on the right is jazz, they give a dove.
Well, there are some.
If you think the one on the left is jazz, and the one on the right is Superman, they give a dove.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is Six . But, you know something?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
The categories have to indicate something that they choose, not that defines them.
You often see this problem with those huge funds of funds.
supposedly, who are they reporting?
My fourth category: Convition complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very complicated decision -- a car purchase.
This is a German manufacturer maker that allows you completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to cut the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
Color, outside of the car . I have 56 possibilities.
Motor, box box -- four choices.
What I'm going to do is I'm going to vary the order in which decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from many options , 56 colors, at a few, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few options, four boxes , 56 colors, lots of choices.
And what am I going to look at?
How involved you are.
If you apply the button button in every decision, this indicates that they're overwhelmed, or it's: we're losing them.
We find that those who are going from many choices in a few, they shake the button over and over again, and another one else.
We lose them.
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was altered the order in which information is presented.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn how to choose.
Although I choose the box of change, I don't say anything about the preferences of inner decoration, in all ways we prepare to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more hooked with the process.
To summarize.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choice overload: cutting, eliminating strange alternatives; concrete, make it real; classify, we can handle more categories with less options; conditions complexity.
All of these techniques I've presented you were designed to help manage alternatives, or better, for you to use them in their issues, or for people who serve.
I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful by choosing.
And the more careful we are in our choices, the more we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '80s, in the Middle East Germany, if you had a typewriter typewriter, you had to record it into the government.
I had to record a sheet of text text written with the machine.
And this so that government could track the origin of texts.
If you found a writing with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we didn't think that someone could do this, how much this would limit freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer of any big manufacturer, and you print a page, that page will end up having some printed yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can catch the attacks according to their attacker.
There are three main groups.
There are criminals.
Like Mr. Diamous Bronx in the city of Kiev, in Ukraine.
The mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a lot of money.
There are really many cases of millionaires online, billionaires, who gained money with their attacks.
This is Vladimir Sadura, from Toyota, Estonia.
This is Alfred Loan.
This is Stephen Watt.
This is humpback Sunday.
These are Matthew Anderson, Tanzania Darwivia, etc., etc.
These guys make their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means through banking toilets to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in a infected computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, froze the Swiss account of this Mr. Jain, and this account had 14 million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. Jain, the Mr. Jain, is unknown.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is victims of a crime that of real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes from bad at worst.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of speakers in importance that we observe today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves them, they motivate them, they motivate the opinions, they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have collapsed over the last 12 months to occupy a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main breakthroughs: the criminals that make it for money, the high-tech subjects like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national states that attack.
And then we see cases like the picture of Diagram.
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
You know, you're a contrary authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
I declared the war the last fall because of a bribe.
They wrote the security of the site and they perpetrated a cyberattacks.
Last week, I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives, asked one of the leaders if they found the death of people because of the attack to Dignator.
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die by a attack of these?
Now, you'll notice it's an alternational authority.
They sell certificate.
What do the certificates serve?
Well, you need if you have a website with set, economic encrypted services, services like Gmail.
It except you to intercept an foreign supermarket authority.
It's going to be able to transmit certified certificate.
And in the case of Diagram happening exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt?
Well, in Egypt, protesters took the police secret Egyptian police in April 2011 and during the building of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called``HIV . ''
And within that folder, there were notes of a firm company in Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept large-scale communications communication communications.
They had sold this tool for 2,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The company's headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to the totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the Student Robinson -- a narrative used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a simple criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intervened.
But today it goes beyond today.
You intercept Internet connection.
They will use even tools like the State State to infect our computer with a trade to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to online discussions, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be,``Well, it seems something wrong, but I don't really affect because I'm a honest citizen.
Why worry?
I have nothing to hide . ''
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play with privacy.
Privacy is not arguing.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right we manage today, it will be forever.
Will we trust any future government, in a administration that could be within 50 years?
These are the questions we need to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live . I live in Kenya, in the South National Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi doesn't have close to the majority of the South, which means that wild animals like the zebras migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like lions, follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our livestock.
This is one of those who killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning and found it dead, I felt very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the masses, we think we come from the sky with our animals and all the land to replace them, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up hearing a lot to lions.
They are warriors that protect our community and livestock, and they're also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, age six to nine, is responsible for the cattle of his father, and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were afraid.
But I realized that actually didn't serve, because I even helped the lions to see the dung floor.
I didn't give up . It continued.
A second idea was to use a pacemaker.
I tried to cheat the lions so they thought it was near the stable.
But lions are very smart . They came the first day and saw the monastery, and they were, but the second day, they came back and said,``this thing doesn't move, it's always here . So they jump and killed animals.
So a night was walking around the stable with a torch, and that day the lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions have fear of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that I'm going to understand and turn off the lights.
And this is a small lamp of a broken flashlight.
It's going to take everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery supply electricity to the little Pandora box . I call it a transformative.
And the Pandora box makes the lights flash.
As you can see, the bulbs go out, because that's where the lions come from.
And this is how you see lions when they come at night.
The lights flash and they deceive lions to think that I'm walking through the stable, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, and he asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them up . You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, to scare other predators like hyenas, leopards, and also being used to overcome elephants of farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Bioch International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funding and awareness.
I even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to put them.
So, one year ago, I was just a kid in the front sides of the booth crawling my father's cows, and I used to see airplanes flying, and he told me that one day would be within one.
And I'm here today.
I got the opportunity to come up for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an aviation of aviation and pilot when it grows.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving my dad's cows and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
South OK . What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you get a scholarship . Richard Sun: Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one on your list?
RSW: My next invention is -- I want to do an electric fence . CA: One electric fence?
RSW: I know you already invented the electric fences, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I try once, right?
Let's dive in every step that you go, my friend.
Thank you very much . RW: Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called``Not envy . ''
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim English's story, but we never learned much from the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, Japan are enemies.
Although sometimes I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I'd spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor, and I myself had never happened.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter of my sister.
That he said,``When you read this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're recorded together in the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're prepared to die . ''
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't delete from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child hiding in his arms watching the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very worried about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine hand in North Korea in the middle of the 1990s.
At the end, more than a million Koreans died during the famine and just a few survived eating grass, insects and tree cuts.
They also got more and more prevalent energy cuts, all around me was completely dark at night in the night, except for sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the river River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very anxious in certain points, allowing Koreans to cross.
But many die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of the North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine, I was sent to China to live with distant relatives.
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as a recorders.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the Korean refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be replicated to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became true, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and they were interested in the police station.
Someone had accused me to be an architect, so they tested my skills in Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and sports.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
The end of the interrogation said to another,``This was a fake report . She's not new . ''
And they let me go . It was a miracle.
Some of them in China are looking for asylum in foreign embassy.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and sports.
These women were very lucky.
Though they had caught them, they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and reported to North Korea, where they're tortured, correctiveness or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans haven't had so much luck.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all its world can be taken into an instant.
That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
In South Korea, it was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all Koreans, but inside, we've become very different because of 67 years of division.
They even go through a crisis crisis.
Am I an exploration or an recording?
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call my pride.
Although adapting to life in South Korea wasn't easy, I made a plan . I started studying for the income exam to college.
Just when I started to adapt to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities hit some money that sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location outside.
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and walked into the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked everybody's identification, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, I kept standing up, and I told him that they were service people who was exploring.
He looked at me carefully, but fortunately I believed.
We did all the way to the border of Lagos.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe border guards in Lagos.
But even after you pass the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the illegally border.
After paying tickets and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital of Lords.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything for free to my family, and we were so close, but my family was held in prison in prison at the distance of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or exceptions.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asking,``What's the problem?
I was so surprised that a stranger would matter to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without doubt, the man went to the ATM, and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two Koreans and take them from prison.
I thank you with all my heart, and I asked him,``Why does it help me? ''
\" I'm not helping you ,"he told me.
\" I'm helping the Korean village . ''
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The nice discovery symbolizes a new hope for me and for the Korean people when we needed it.
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the hopes of hope that the male people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many Koreans are separated from their families, and when they're up to a new country, they start with little or any money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language practices, work practice, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family, and we send information and money that's helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very lucky, I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more Koreans contributing all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South America.
This is Southern Center: clip stores, fast food, ball terrain.
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the name of Central Center to represent something else, so they changed it to Los South Angeles, as if this will fix what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles: Line shops, fast food, ball terrain.
Like 25 million other Americans, living in a food desert, Los Angeles Center South, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to bring kills more people than food in the car.
People are dying from curable diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than, say, Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I'm tired of seeing this happening.
And I wonder, how would you feel if they didn't have access to healthy food, and if you get out of home, you see the harmful effects that the current food system has in your neighborhood?
I see wheelchair chairs, and sold as used cars.
I see color centers like Starbucks.
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And also, I'm glad to drive 45 minutes back and forth to buy a apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, I was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a land of land that we call a gardening.
It's about 45 feet three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
And I said,``Well, I can do what it comes to me in win, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it . ''
This is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green Group, we put together and started planting our food forest, fruit trees, you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do, we're a kind of group paid by anti-degree gardens from all the processes, from all the city and completely voluntary, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone complained.
The city came up to me, and in summary, I was given a ritual saying that I had to withdraw my garden, the ritual became a court.
And I said,``Go, really?
A court order to plant food on a piece of land that no one matters?"then he was like,``I'm just sorry.
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve Lord, and he talked to the gift and one of the members of Green County, who put a petition in Change.org , 900 firms, we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My thesis even called to say that they supported and loved what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is American city with more bad terrain.
It's got 26 miles of bad terrain.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 325 million plants of tomato plants.
Why don't you look good at this?
It will grow a plant to give a thousand , 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars of output.
It's my anthem, when I tell people, grow your own food.
Growing your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Central South.
I grew up there . I grew up my children there.
I refuse to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufactured for me by others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The gardening is my graffiti, I grow my art.
Like a graffiti artist, I'm wearing walls, I slow soils, gardening.
I use the garden, the land, like a canvas piece, and plants and trees, are my flower of that canvas.
They would be surprised to see what the land can do, if you let it be their canvas.
They simply can't imagine how amazing a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became an education tool, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They would be surprised to see how they affect kids.
The gardening is the most therapeutic and provocative act that you can do, especially in a corruption.
Also, you get strawberries.
I remember an occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, were like 185 o'clock at night, and they were in my garden, and they were out and look very quickly.
I, good, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger, and this only reinforces why I do this, people ask me,``Well, don't you fear that people are going to steal your food? ''
And I say,``For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to steal it . ''
That's what it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at his time, I want you to take your health . ''
There was another time when I put a garden in a refugee shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the truck.
It was fabulous, they shared his stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with his mom and grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so it was just for a moment.
That's how Big Routes has come to plant maybe 20 gardens.
We've had, like about 50 people coming, work and participate, all in voluntary plan.
If kids grow tail, kids eat color.
If you grow tomatoes, you'll eat tomatoes, but if none of these are taught, if you're not taught how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind people who put them in front.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're stuck in . I see color boys who are on this path designed for them, which doesn't lead them nowhere.
With the gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are being engaged from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you produce the next George Washington House.
But if we don't change the composition of the earth, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy coffee.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to hold it up.
What I'm talking about is to put people working, taking kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy.
I want you all to become a lawyer, fundamental expressions, serious gardens.
We have to change the script of what a germ is.
If you're not a gardener, you're not a warrior.
That the CEOs take their agreement?
That's their choice weapon.
In sum, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me, don't call you in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some shit -- to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, they come to the garden with your dad so that we can plant something.
Peace: Thank you.
Thank you.
( Medical sound) You probably everybody agrees with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt, and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that's missing.
And especially if you're riding in your bike and these cars pass, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road.
The solution for that is making asphalt roads.
The porous paradise, a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can pass through it, so all the rainwater flows down to the side and have a road for which it's easy to drive, and they're not going to get water.
Noise will also disappear in these pores.
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has disadvantages, of course, and the downside of this road is that you can undo.
What is to get rid? See that in this road, the stones on the surface are coming out.
First of a stone, then several more and more and more and so on, and then -- well, don't do that . But they can give you their windshield, and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create girls with that.
Ah . It's ready.
Bach, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage appears in this material.
It's a porous paradise, as I said, so it only has a little amount of warning between the stones.
Because of the intersection, the ultraviolet light, to the rusty, this warning, the glue, the glue between the dry, will be coming up, and if you get into it, you'll become metals and separated from the added.
So if you drive through the road, you'll take the added -- like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of self-repair materials.
If we can make this material, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool, from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the button.
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use to cook -- a induction machine.
The induction can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the kiss, the kiss flow through these microscopes and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine here in the stage here.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, which now I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought,``Well, that's very interesting . We have to try it . ''
So we got a piece of road , 400 meters away from the Barrian Highway, where we had to do a trial lane to test this material.
So that's what we did there . You see where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage . That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of load on them, we repair them then with our induction machine and we repair them, and we went back to test.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of induction to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, can even double the life of the surface, and really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the sample here . It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cooling first before I can show you how the repair act.
But I'm going to make an attempt.
Let's see . Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of my house in my house.
My father was listening BBC News in his little gray radio.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news generally depressed him.
\" The Taliban went down! ``, I screamed my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
\" Now you can go to a real school ,"he told me.
One morning I'll never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban was asked by Afghanistan and made illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was dressed as a child to escort my older sister, who could no longer be alone, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that two could educate us.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where we were.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us sitting in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew we risk our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban suspected.
We always wondered what they knew about.
Were they following us?
Did you know where we live?
We were terrified, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a treasure.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total conference of a remote province of Afghanistan . insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was invited.
But my mother grew became a teacher.
This is her.
It will take two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
For him, there was a bigger risk in not to educate his children.
For the years of the Taliban, I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to quit, but my father said,``me, daughter me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money . You can forced your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, which is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So don't you want to continue? ''
Today I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age's women have more than school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud of graduate in Grey College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was exiled from his home for the courage of educating her daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate me.
He's not only about my college title, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry him driving by the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for ...
That's why I'm the global ambassador of 1985, a global campaign to educate women.
It's why I cofounded States, the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like the mine, lawyers for them, despite and even in front of a daunting opposition.
Like Ahmed . It's not its true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going from the way from Istanbul to his village, and literally, they escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they're the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would try and try it.
\" Look at me, if you want ,"he said,``But I won't hurt the future of my daughter for your old and supported ideas . ''
What I've given you about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we succeed, there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter, and that he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, it's often the first compelling interests of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban, the girls who went to school are told in hundreds -- remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
I fear that these changes don't last long, after the retreat of the U.S. troops.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who advocate for them, that they animate them, I see a future and a lasting future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited possibilities, and every day the girls of Istanbul remember me.
Like me, they dream in big.
Thank you.
Never, I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the exile,``Son, resist Gaddafi . Against him.
But you never have a fair revolutionary revolutionary . ''
They've spent almost two years since the top revolution inspired by the literature of mass mobilization so much of the Tunisian revolution as well.
A forces with many other civil citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and start a revolution against the French regime of Gaddafi.
And we did it; it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the forefront, demanding the fall of the regime, carrying goals of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown an example of the face of the dictatorship of Gaddafi.
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses of about 50,000 dead dead, we managed to release our country and defeat the tyrant.
However, Gaddafi left a heavy burden, a legacy legacy, corruption and architecture seeds.
For four decades, the Southern regime of Gaddafi destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of civil society.
So aware of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved, along many other women, rebuild civil civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and fair towards democracy and national reconciliation.
They were established about 200 organizations in Geneva during, and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Philadelphia.
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops about developing capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the platform of Women Libya for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, very diverse orientation, to advocate for the political autonomy of women and for our own equal participation of the woman and for our equal participation of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the electoral period -- an environment that was getting more and more polarizing, which is the role of selfish and exclusion policies.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won about 175 percent of the National Congress in the first elections in 52.
However, slowly, the business of elections and revolution as a whole, were disappearing; every day we found violence news.
One day we woke up with the news of ancient mosques and Sufi graves.
Another day I stayed with the murder of the American ambassador and the car attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of the officers of the army.
And every day, every day we wake up with the military government and their continued violations of human rights and their lack of respect of the law.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, is polarizing more, and it's gone away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the cones of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all to inspire you with our history of the``exploit list"and the elections.
Now, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we choose bad, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't bring peace, stability and security to Libya.
The list and the international list and the alternative between candidates and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation?
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why does our society continue polarized and dominated with selfish and exclusion policies, both for men like women like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and inclusion.
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed choices, which only reinforce polarization and divide.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of the female to need the numerical and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech, not only honor, but also put the mercy in practice, instead of the revenge, collaboration instead of competition, even instead of exclusion.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by war, desperately needs the end of reaching peace.
Because peace has an alchemy that's about interaction and abundance between female perspectives and men.
That's the true seed.
We need to establish that in an existential way before doing it in a political form.
According to a version of the Koran``Saudi"-- peace --``the word of the Richard God, [release], compassionate . ''
At the same time, the word``red ,"which is known in all the hierarchical traditions, has the same root root that the word``rat"-- uterus -- by combining the feminine and the material, that span all the humanity in which men and women, which all the tribes and all the peoples have ever bought.
And so, just like the uterus completely covers the embryo, that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion every single existence.
This is what he says,``My mercy takes all things . ''
This is what it says to us,``My mercy is about my anger . ''
That all of them are given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an intriguing question, which has an equally intriguing response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody does always: Why she left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who pays him?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old . I just mentioned at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in the Snow magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green email, American Express, and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I created my twin soul, he pointed to my head with a gun, loaded with battery bullets.
The man, he loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and threatened with killing me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of``crazy love, a psychological trap, a defense of love, where they fall every year, millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a kid in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA on Market Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for the list``Fortune 500 ,"between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo Monterey and The Washington Post.
I took nearly 20 years with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black worker, and I drive a Hong Odyssey.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all race, all the religions, all levels of profitable and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the restaurants are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate, interdependent and long-term relationships or, in the families, the last place where we want or hope to find violence, which is why, the domestic abuse is so puzzling.
I would have told them that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who was beating, and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, novels and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congress in a cold and rain night.
I was sitting next to me in New York subway, and began to float with me.
He told me two things.
The first was that he also had just taken away from a university of the Vill College University and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a guy in the field.
He had a big deal like apples, and a wheat black hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that I've made, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He made it all over the beginning in a pedestal.
We started going out and loved everything from me: that it was ready, who had gone to Harvard, who would be able to help teenage girls, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
He believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as anyone had ever done.
And that was why the bachelor in that prestigious school and the work in Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase of any domestic violence relationship is to be seduced and made the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is to isolate it.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave my dreams' work, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted, quit my job and I icons and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a``crazy love ,"which was entering a head in a physical, physically, psychological trap and psychological trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how she react.
And this is where those guns come in.
As soon as we moved to New England, you know, that site where he was supposed to be confident had to feel so safe to buy three guns.
One had it on the front of the car.
Another one would hold it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those posts because of trauma that lived from small.
He needed them to feel safe.
But those clues were actually a message for me, and, although I had never raised my hand, my life was already serious, every minute every minute.
The first physical attack of Congress occurred five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and he still had the shrimp.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mom's girlfriend from my mother and married me.
Despite what had happened, I was confident that we would live happy forever, because I loved her, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very depressing.
It just had felt very overwhelmed by the wedding and the fact of forming a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I would never get hurt.
I spent two times more on our honey.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach and lost me, and he gave me so strong in the head that I took several times against the window of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, he ran down the traffic and threw me a Big Mac from the face.
He continued continued by giving me one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or harassment at some point in their life, and the Control Control Center that every year 15 million children are battered , 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I stay?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, fell in love with a deeply tormented man, and it was the only person in the world who could help Congress face their demons.
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't it just go?
Why didn't I go? I could have gone anytime.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you ignore: it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a bat.
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill it.
More than 70 percent of the murder in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has put the relationship to the relationship, after getting killed, because then the abuse has no longer anything to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent harassment, even after the abuse has gone back to marry, denial of financial resources, and the manipulation of the family system of family to kill the victim and their children, who are normally forced by the judges to spend their mother didn't survive with their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it just doesn't go?
I was able to leave myself, because of a last piece of music that came up my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, I would have killed if I was allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told everybody, the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you help me.
We have the tendency to redefine victims as special headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods.
The question,``why is it left?
For some people, it's a way to say,``The fault is its self for staying ,"as if the victims choose immediately in love with men who want to destroy us.
But since I published``crazy love ,"I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also escaped, who learned a relative lesson of what happened to them, and they rejected their lives happy and happy lives as employees, wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I came back to marry a man and a nice man, and we have those three children.
I have that black worker and also that mission.
What I'm not going to do is, I'm not going to have any more, it's never, it's a carrying pistol pointing to my head in hands of someone who says it wants me to.
Right now, as you're thinking,``Hey, that's fascinating!"or``Oh, what silly was, but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being battered or that they were small or that they are administrators themselves.
The focus could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad particular love breaking silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse thrive only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply by shedding light on it.
The victims need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They take the focus of the light talking about it with their children, their coworkers, their friends and family.
They reframe their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people, who have a full future.
They recognize early violence signs to intervene consciously, to slow up their scale and show the victims a safe output.
Together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful homes that should be.
Thank you.
Hi . I call Cameron Russell, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be accurate, for 10 years.
And I feel that right now there is an uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed like this . luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first piece of clothing on a TED stage, so you're very lucky to witness it, I think.
If some of the women were horrified when it appeared, they don't have to tell me now, but I'll find it later on on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These contacts are very uncomfortable; less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to pass this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so don't do anything as I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also surface.
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me to throw up the back and to embrace the hair of the boy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan like the one who made me two days ago for work, there's very little we can do to transform our aspect, which, although superficial and unchanging, has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being courageous means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful and white woman, and in my working sector, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but in a sincere way.
The first question is, how does it become model?
And I always say,``A politician discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the benefit of a heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries, we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to admire, we've also associated it to a high and solar shape, and a white skin.
And that's my heritage, heritage that I've known to harness to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now skeptical now, and maybe there are some of the lovers in the fashion that say -- wait . There's Naomi, Doaa, Joan Mallyway, Liber Lion.
First of all, the happy to know so many of models . It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from New York City told each and every one of the models in the runway, and from the 2020 controllers, only 27, is to say less than four percent, they weren't white.
The next question that people always do is, can I be model when it's bigger?
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then, what I would really tell you to each of these girls is: Why? You can be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a color surgeon and a poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say,``I know my boss.
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of head of American Medical magazine or the executive director of H & M, or the next Steven Mexico.
To say, you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike corporate surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've done your studies, and you have a rsum and a few jobs to your back, no matter what you say, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but your rsum said,``underwear model for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are being recovered.
And yes, they're basically being played all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture they took me, and also the first time I used a bikini, and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a girl.
So it lights up next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a pick party a few days before the photos for the French House.
Here I am with my soccer team and in the V magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They're creations of a group of professionals, chickens, makeup, photographers and styles, and all their bodies and people of press and gambling, and they get to create this . That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is: Do you get things free?
I have too many about 20 inches and I never use it, except the previous pair, but the privilege I get in the real life, and we don't like to talk.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop, and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I traveled with my friend who was a very bad driver; he was jumped in red, and, of course, they stopped us, and I just feel an agent, agent to keep driving.
I enjoy these privilege for my aspect, not because of what I am, and there are people who are paying a price for their mind no matter who they are.
I lived in New York City, and last year, from 140 teenagers to the ones who were stopped and recorded , 86 percent were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.
And there are only 7,000 young black young people in New York, so for them, is not a question of me?
But how many times would you stop me? And when?
By researching for this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the 13 years old in the United States, they don't like their body, and that number is up to 78 percent at 17.
So, the last question that people do is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you hope is, if you're a little bit more thin and you have the most bright hair, you feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like this.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative, resourceful and passionate people.
And that's true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say before the cameras, which I've never said before them, is, I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever ask yourself: Do you know, with some more thin legs and hair brighter, be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the thinner legs, the most bright hair and the most trendy clothes, but they're probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something to get out of this talk, I hope that everyone is more comfortable when you recognize the power of image in perception that we have the success and the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was older enough to take a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 most precious pictures, and I didn't go to them.
There were no artistic directors, no styles, no opportunity to repeat photos, not even a minimum care in the lighting.
In fact, most of them took random tourists.
My story starts when, meeting me in New York City to give a power, my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday . That's the corner of 57 and five.
I gave the chance that we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter was approached, my wife told me,``Why don't you take you to taste New York in a Jack trip and continue the ritual? ''
So here's when we started asking the tourists to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture to deliver the camera at a complete stranger is so universal.
Nobody has ever been denied, and fortunately, no one has ever fled the camera.
So, we weren't aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five-year-old girl could understand him.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not only at physical level, but in all the senses.
Because even though we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter takes new bits, and I can see life through his eyes and how perceived and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when suddenly he stopped in dry and pointed out a red canopy of the wrist store that he stopped with small visits.
And I described what I had felt like five years of foot on that same place.
I began to remember his heart to be able to be able to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what I look in in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in creating memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't have a lot of family photos.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and you don't doubt to come up with someone and ask them: Is it taking a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The nanotubes are in the fastest group group.
First of all, why do you have so bad press?
It's also associated with Disney laughter care, stupid, stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following laughter Kenyan press, applause and animations, these are the attributes that associate with the Kenyan Parliament, but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it . You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean, the parliament don't help prevent disease spread.
They're very difficult . They're far away from extinct . And my favorite, the farmers have better presence . There are two kinds of Canadian on this planet.
There are the New World's grandparents that are mostly found in the Americas, like the Indus and the roads, and the Old World Jews, where we have 16 species , 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the farmers important? First of all, provide vital ecological services . Clean.
They're our natural garbage collectors.
They clean the fisheries up to the bone.
They help kill all bacteria . They help absorb the anthrax than not being because of them, it would spread and cause huge losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no farmers, parents take three to four times more time to break down, and this has huge branching in the disease of disease.
The grandparents also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
Kevin was the symbol of the protective and the maternity and, along with the cobra, symbolizes the unit between the height and the Egypt.
In Indian mythology, Jacque was the barber god, and he risked his life to save the seventh of the 10 heads of the devil of 10 warheads.
In the Tibetan culture, they're done very important amounts of light to open sky . In places like Tibet, there's no place to bury dead, or wood to compress them, so these nanotubes provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the nanotubes?
We have eight species of Canadian in Kenya, which six are in extreme threat.
The reason is that they're being poisoned, and the reason that they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and wildlife . The federal communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the Jews are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of Whitopia are at the critical endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the livestock consumption that has been treated with an analog drug like the Francisco.
This drug has been banned for veterinarians in India and have taken a posture.
Since there are no farmers, there has been a spread in the number of street dogs in landfill landfill, and when you have street dogs, you have a huge bomb bomb bomb bomb . The number of rage cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the greatest wind parks in Africa : 333 Archives are going to be above the Turkana lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds . They cut them down half.
They're birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of dead farmers to serve the surgeon and the market market.
So what's being done? Well, we're looking at these birds . We're putting transmitters.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that travel for different countries, so focusing on a problem locally is not going to be.
We have to work with governments in the regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the farmers, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that provide.
How can you help? You can become active, making noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very intricate creatures . donate your time to spread the word.
When they come out of this room, they're informed about the nanotubes, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors, with their neighbors.
They're very elegant . Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them flying effortlessly, without energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
Since 1971 to 1977, I young young, but I'm not . I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory of ivory, Algeria and Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NGO, and every project we set in Africa.
And I was disturbed.
I thought, at 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we did is we've got it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book,``From the Maleth ,"was a project where an Italian decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So, we came with Italian seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends towards the Michael River, and we teach the local crowds to grow Italian and career tomatoes, and ...
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes, they don't agree . We were amazed that the local, in so fertile valley, would not have had agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that they didn't grow anything, we simply said,``Thank God we're here . ''
And of course, everything in Africa is really grown.
We got these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy, a tomato would grow up to this size . In Zambia, this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the villagers,``Look how easy agriculture is . ''
When the tomatoes were nice, mature and red, overnight at night, about 200 cheaper addicted from the river and ate everything, and we said to the changes,``Oh my God, we chop them! ''
And the ambulance said,``Yeah, we don't have agriculture here ."`` Why didn't they say?
I thought that only us the Italians made mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what Americans did, what English did, what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, we're at least feeding them.
You should see the waste -- you should see the waste that we vote to the people's confidence.
He wants to read a book, read```` Death Death ,"Manhattan economist.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that that money has caused.
Just read your book.
I read it from a female woman, the damage we've done.
Westerners are imperial, collaborative missionaries, and we treat people just two ways: or the sponsors, or we are alternatives.
The two words come from the Latin Latin root, which means``father . ''
However, it means two different things.
Parliament, I treat any of a different culture like my kids were .``I want you a lot . ''
Parkinson, I treat all of a different culture as if they were my servants.
So the white in Africa are called``human ,"boss.
That book gave me a slap on the face .```` The little bit is beautiful ,"written by Halc, who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be helped, pains alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respect.
This morning, the gentleman opened up this conference put a cane on the ground and said,``Can you imagine a city that is not a collection? ''
I decided at 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called Company Michael, where you never start anything, you never start anything, but it becomes a nerdy of local passion, the CEO of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So, what do you do? It goes down.
It's never coming to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of locality.
We don't work from office.
We sat down in a cafe . We put together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we help them find knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, we listen to them? But not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never attend, and they'll never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified.
So, planning has this blind dot.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family of business, the family's family doctor, which is established with you in your house, in your kitchen table, in coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in hopes, West Australia City.
I was making a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this hidden garbage that we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in the march, and the government came to me to see,``How can you do that?
How can you do it?"And I said,``I did something very, very, very difficult.
So the government says,``Make it again ."We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying from loneliness.
Peter President, one of the most great corporate advisers in history, passed at 96, a few years ago.
Peter President was a philosophy professor before involved in business, and this is what Peter Zuckerberg says,``planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company . ''
The planning is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer them disease, privacy, it has to be fantastic when you help them, and then they'll be able to go in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you show . Have you clapping this morning?
That's what you have clapping . .
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first of the first fossil, both renewables, manufacturing -- and from one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The brake as a way of holding machinery is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we nurture, we cure, we educate, we build, we communicate seven billion people in a sustainable form.
There's no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent technology for green revolution? universities? Forget it!
government? Forget it!
They're going to be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an adorable story that I read in a futuristic journal many, many years.
There were a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year 1860.
And in 1860, this group of people gathered together, and they speculate about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was together: New York City didn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and pointed, if the population kept growing up to this rate, to move to the population of New York around them, they would require six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would impossible to address.
They were already spreading in dung . therefore, in 1860, they were dividing this dirty technology that would destroy New York's life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in the next 40 years, in the United States, they came up with 1,100 auto manufacturing companies , 1980.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed, and there were very few, astronomical, factories in separate places.
Detric, Michigan . Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer them disease.
Otherwise, they won't talk to you.
Then you have to give them an absolute, dedicated, enthusiastic service.
And, fortunately, you will have to tell them the truth with respect to understanding.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things: the product that you wish to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing, and you have to tell a great financial management.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and search for the money alone.
There is no.
This is still not born.
We've investigated and looked at the 100 companies with the Carnegie world, Christian, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.
There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was initiated by one person.
Never the word``me ,"but the word``us ,"32 times.
He wasn't alone when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone . Nobody.
So, we can create the community where we have fascinations, who come from a small business environment sitting in coffee, in the bars next to their dedicated drugs who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this danger, somebody who will ask you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, can you sell? Can you look for money? ''
\" Oh, no, I can't do that ."`` I'd like to look for somebody?
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't exchange a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like conservatives, templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their apartments?
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understanding better our landscape?
How do we share our hopes into the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and dreams?
I live in New Orleans, and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds relief with the giant oak that you give to lovers, drunk and dreamer from centuries and I trust in a city.
There is a parade in New Orleans, there's a parade in New Orleans . The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the most American American properties.
I live near this house, and I thought, how could I turn it into a more enjoyable space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was Joan, like a mother for me.
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this made me a profound gratitude for time living.
It gave clarity to the meaningful things of my current life.
But I'm willing to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to let me go through the day a day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house abandoned in a giant blackboard and painted about her phrases to complete:``Before I die I . ''
So the conservatives could take a chalk, reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day, the wall was full and kept covering.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
\" Before I die I want to be judged by piracy ."`` Before I die, I want to sit down on the line of date . ''
\" Before I die, I want to sing for millions of people . ''
\" Before I die I want to plant a tree . ''
\" Before I die, I want to live out of the network . ''
\" Before I die I want to embrace it again . ''
\" Before I die I want to go to someone's rescue . ''
\" Before I die I want to be completely myself . ''
This abandoned space became constructive, and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at boards, they gave me apart, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone . It's about understanding our neighbors in new new ways, and it's about giving birth to reflection and contemplation, and remember what's most important to us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and now they've done walls in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we demonstrate the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of increasing distraction, it's more important than ever, finding ways to conserve the perspective and remember that life is short and delicate.
Death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing us for death is one of those things that trust us more power.
Think about death, our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters as individuals and as communities and more media to share hopes and fears and stories, people around us not only can help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
It's 22 years old, it's high and very handsome.
I don't speak, but convey joy better than some of the best speakers.
Leymah knows what love is.
The sharing share is what happens.
It's not funny . It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about the religious differences and joy on this: Never lied.
When I sing songs of our childhood, trying to pronounced words that I can't even remember, I remember one thing: how little we know about mind and how wonderful it must be.
Samuel is 16 years old . It's high . It's very handsome.
It has the most unpredictable memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year I came out every single one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I stood in my arm during the first episode of The Superlow and the birthday Garden birthday.
Doesn't it seem incredible?
But most people disagree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit the concept of normality, they're often ignored and understood.
But what drives my heart and I blew my soul up was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them inside the ordinary, that could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar families with the term``autism ,"is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual, it manifest differently, from there that Rome is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, you diagnose a new case of autism, and although it's one of the developmental disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause or cure cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When I was a few months ago, I realized that he was different.
He was a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived alive and reinvented in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would be between media.
As it grew, it became more different, and the differences were getting more obvious.
But beyond the constraints, frustration and endless hyperactivity, there was something really unique: pure nature and innocent, a child who saw the world without prejudice, a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I would have wish that they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change for normal.
The normal passes by high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Rome and Sam and you, it would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences we have -- they're a gift! Every one of us has a gift in their inner, and, honestly, the pursuit of normality is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for greatness, progress and change in the moment we try to be like others.
Please -- they don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been to be Alice in the country of the wonders.
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, giving a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared . It was scared . It's scared . scared from these students with their great minds, their great books and their great words and unknown words.
But by developing those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when he fell down the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had these conversations with students, and they surprised me the ideas they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are those who are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to the environment and care care, among others, and if we don't know about this, the work is not made, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists having these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, talk to us with simple.
I want to share some suggestions about how they can do to make sure that we can see that their science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question to answer: and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
They don't just tell us that they study the calculators, but they study the circles, which are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat osteoporosis.
And when they're describing their science, care with the jargon.
The jargon is a obstacle for our understanding of ideas.
Sure, you can say,``spatial and temporary ,"but why not say``space and time ,"which is much more accessible to us?
Make them accessible, it's not the same thing to make them silly.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies . They're ways to plug and excited with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about``bullet"signs.
You've been wondering why they call``bullet ,"what do the bullets do? The bullets kill, and they kill their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the area of the language of our brain and overwhelmed us.
Instead, this film of Ben Brown is much more effective . It shows that the special structure of calculating is so strong that it really inspired the unique Tower of the Eiffel Tower.
The trick here is to use a simple, flexible phrase that the public can understand if it loses a little bit, and then provide graphs that make our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what's described.
I think these are just some key ones that can help the others open the door and see the country of the wonders that science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when they've solved this equation, all over the media, please with simple . Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire English Dictionary is```` Really slight . ''
Just because it sounds very well.
And``Resultest"means``dishonest policy . ''
Although there was a 21st-century 21st-century editor that defined it much better when he said,``A Structure"is the one who seeks a public burden without matter, platform or principle, and that, when he wins, it gets it for the mere use of a strength that's broken . ''
I have no idea what it means```` reflection . ''
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't until, for example , 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the name of Brad Spanish, who confronted the parliament.
They put him in the London Tower, and they were incarcerated, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase,``This ball like the metal . ''
Most people think it's literal.
It's not . It's for a freedom of the freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to come back to America just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a Republican country?
This was found in Congress for a long time.
They presented all kinds of suggestions that might have forged.
Some people wanted to call it``The Bionic State Bob ,"and others,``His General George Washington ,"and other``Depression of the U.S. People's People's People's People . ''
Not very encouraging.
Some just wanted to call it``King . ''
They thought it was the quality of quality.
And it wasn't even markers, they had the idea that you could be elected by King for a certain deadline.
And it might have served.
Everybody's got married immediately, because this debate was flooded for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor senator, and he always wrote,``still with this topic.
What caused the portrait and the thing was that the House of representative was against the Senate.
The House of representative didn't want Washington to be empowered.
They didn't want to call it King for if he was given him or his successor.
So, they wanted to give it the most modest, more insignificant and more unfortunate title that came up with them.
And that title was``president . ''
President . They didn't invent the title . There was before, but it only meant``somebody who's lost a meeting . ''
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more than the term``foreman"or``supermarket . ''
There were ancient presidents of small colleagues and government failure, but it was really an insignificant title.
And that's why the Senate is opposed.
They said,``it's ridiculous, we can't call it President.
\" This guy has to sign treaties and meet foreign professionals . ''
\" And who will take it seriously with such ridiculous and insignificant title as America? ''
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't stop.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never really conceived the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate to come in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is temporary -- -- is possible that we keep waiting for 203 more years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this I want to leave you, is that the U.S. President of America doesn't sound so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of UAVs and so forth.
The reality and history has dropped the title of the great.
So finally won the Senate.
They got their diploma.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of uniqueness -- well, it was a singularity for then.
But do you know how many nations have now president?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of representatives lost, because no one's going to feel humble when you tell them that they're the President of America.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I'd like to leave you.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually, the most words made much more words than these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to subway in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust, and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the rock of sweat bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk, but most of all, that cacophony of male male and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a barrel of sudden light, attached to the head with this anti-degree south, and I can barely distinguish the branches that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
My hand was slipped and suddenly I remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and fell countless feet in that pit.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole, risk their lives without paying and reward, and often dying.
I walked out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do, because they're prey from slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only exhibition in the Vancouver Peace Summit.
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met an interface in the Middle States, a NGOs who are dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery, and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not such as degree.
When we finished talking, I felt very bad; honestly I was embarrassed to ignore this attraction of our days, and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I came up with my stomach knot and, weeks later, flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the England, and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these sites.
Some, even, I considered them my second home.
But this time, it would vibrate the dirty buses.
A conservative calculation says that there are currently more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of Africans displaced throughout the entire transatlantic slave.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent to a $50,000 today.
And yet, today you can enslave the entire entire families for $18 dollars of $18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled with false promises of good education and better work to find out that they're forced to work without paying, under threat of violence and they can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in trade: goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable.
slavery exists in almost everybody, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met brick furnaces.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the Devil Desert.
And in an temperature of 54 C temperature, men, women, children, in fact, entire families wrapped in a heavy dust of powder to mechanically stack bricks in their heads, until 18 at the same time, and take them from ordinary furnaces to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
And the reason of the monotony and the tiredness works in silence, doing this task over and over for 16 hours a day.
There were no breaks to eat, not to drink, and the severe entrance would make it pretty much an intriguing.
So strangers were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to survive it, and sitting there, I thought,``my camera gets a much better treatment that these people.
Back in the furnaces, I wanted to cry, but the protagonist that was next to me quickly grabbed me and said,``Lisa, don't do it . Don't do it here . ''
And he explained very clearly that to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
It couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already.
I had to rely on eBay, and working within the system for their release and trusted that they would get it.
As soon as I, I waited to get home to feel my heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles by mountain terrain to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big plans were more heavy than the children who charge them and children are holding them to their heads with homemade hearts made of sticks, strings and rags.
It's hard to do something so overwhelming.
How can we influence something so insidious, but so pervasive?
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 17 hours a day without paying because this is that whole life.
They have nothing about what to compare.
When these villagers came out of their freedom, the slaves burned closely their homes.
When we hear the slavery, we often think of sexual trafficking and because of this global awareness, they warned me that it would be hard to me to work with security in this particular business.
In Kathmandu, I was accompanied women who were previously sexual slaves.
And they took me through a few cars that gave this dirty basement, a fluorescent light.
It wasn't exactly a brothel.
It was more a restaurant.
And a restaurant, as you know in the office, are local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private, where women are women with their girls and children, some of the only seven years are forced to train customers and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Every single place is dark and dirty, identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer sex abuse by their customers.
From foot on the carpet, I remember having felt an acute acute fear, and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be to be trapped in that hell.
I only had a exit: the stairs where I walked into.
There were no hind doors.
There were no big enough windows to climb.
Those people don't have escape, and because we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in restaurants, in the domestic service and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sexual slaves.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that we often relate with a slave labor hand.
I visited Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade trade.
This is a family portrait.
Black hands of black are the father, the blue wounds and the blue wounds of their children.
They mix paintings on these big barrels, and they dip silk in the liquid to the elbow, but the score is toxic.
My interpretation told me his stories.
\" We don't have freedom ,"they said.
\" We still hope, though, we can get out of this house someday and go somewhere else where we really pay our work . ''
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 slaves in the flying lake, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
Did I see what seemed to be a fisherman family in a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense of it?
Wrong . They were all slaves.
The kids are separated from their family, destroyed families and forced to work with extensive landscapes in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to be quivering, it feared that his little canoe outside of it.
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
So, the branches of the trees of the trees are often catching networks and children, fatigue and fear, are thrown into the water to unleash branches.
Many people drowned.
Ever since I remember, it has always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love, it's not going to flee, and as a whole life has been treated with cruelty, he's usually treated the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they got up the last networks, but they had been working on the one.
At night cold and windy.
And it tends to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed by fish.
I want to introduce you to Kofi.
Kofi was rescued in a fishing village.
I met him in a shelter where the Seattle was rehabilitation for slavery victims.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will become because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
It was driving through a road in Ghana with the Egypt partners, a fellow social partner with his acceleration of suddenly an accelerator, and they climbed our car and played the window.
He asked us to follow it on a dirt path to the forest.
At the end of the road, we got ready to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed this path barely and said,``This is the way, this is the way . Come on . ''
As we started to go down, we took the cracks that blocked the way and after walking around an hour, we found that the road was attached by the recent rains, so I put the photos on my head as we go down in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the tiny path ended abruptly in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with slave workers.
A lot of women had kids tied up their backs, and as they were looking for gold, they were walking in their waters.
The mercury is used in the process of extraction.
These miners are enslaved in a little bit of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were packed in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his tired eyes, irritated, because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The pits have to 90 feet, and these people are carrying heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area in which the stone could be able to extract the gold.
First of all, the site seems to be filled with strong and obscure men, but, if we look closer, we're looking at working for more fortunate and also children.
They're all victims of injury, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this muscle ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and training by mercury in a few years.
This is Mandarin . When his father died his uncle he took him to work with him in mines.
By dying his uncle, American inherit the uncle of uncle that forces him to be slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the lesion of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the mine, so severe that the doctors said it should be amputation.
In addition to that, American has tuberculosis, and it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream about being released and educated with help of local activists like the States, and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to give testimony of them, and we will do everything we can to help change their lives.
I honestly believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines . These are people, real people, like you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I'm going to think of these so many beautiful people, battered, that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope you're going to wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that force fires a fire and that fire shine light on slavery because without that light, the slavery of slavery can continue living in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math applied, and there's a peculiar problem for anyone to do it: we're like management drivers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try and try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
And we get rid of the version of the ballet and the dance dancers that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demands an extraordinary amount of training, a high level of dexterity, and probably certain initial fitness that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend Jane Starchler, who, at his time, was a ballet dancer.
In the last few years, a lot of progress has been progress.
However, there are 3.2 million people in the world who are sick and have to deal with an incurable, tremor weakness, and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in a objective way, and ultimately the only way we know if there's really a cure to be when we have a objective and a laser metric.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson and other movement disorders there are no biological markers, so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best we have is a social test of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it . It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of clinical trials, they never do . It has never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a difficult journey to the clinic . What if patients could do the test themselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a way is not conventional to try and try, in some sense at least, all of us are virtuous like my friend John Starburger.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal chords.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds by talking, and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed.
And like the ballet, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning how to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as they vibrate, and as Parkinson affects limbs, it also affects vocal organs.
On the bottom line you can see an example of glorious genetic strings.
We see the same symptoms.
vocal shake, weakness and stiffness.
The speech becomes more quiet and separated after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these trials based on the voice with the specialized clinical trials? Well, both are not invasive.
The neurological test is not invasive . Both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both skillful . Well, but also the tests based on voice are not specialized.
I mean, they can be driven.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're a minimum cost, and we all know what happens.
When something requires a cost so low: it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals ready to address.
We can reduce the logistics of patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for routine check.
With high frequency monitoring, we could get objective data.
We could make low-cost sacrifice for clinical trials, and for the first time, these are functional objects on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first biomarkers of disease before it's too late.
So, when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the World National Initiative Initiative.
And I joined Ballan and Pakistan, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have accessible local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
Anyone, with or without Parkinson, can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you . Tom Rielly: So Max, taking all these samples from, say 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who's not?
What would you take from these samples?
Max Little: Yeah . What happens is, during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease . TR: Sure.
MW: You see, some people cannot pass it . You may not end it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data that's collected in different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances, because we're looking for the search factors to look for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have 86 percent accuracy right now?
MW: A lot more than that.
Actually, my student Justine, I have to post it, has done a fantastic job, and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what the project does . Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: ninth and nine . Well, it's a improvement.
MW: Of course.
TR: Thank you very much . Max Little, public.
MW: Thank you, Tom.
Before March 2011, he made photographs in New York City.
We are position creatures, gray.
We hide in the dark, in the rooms without windows, and usually we avoid sunlight.
We make the thin thin models, even more thin, the perfect skin still we do the impossible, possible and criticized us in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11 , 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happen in Japan.
Shortly later, an organization where it was voluntary, there Honey Honey was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers, we knew we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, I went to Buffalo.
It's a small village of fishermen located in the Palestine printer of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The recorded water level reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was devastated.
We pulled out the channels and the bees.
We cleaned up schools . We remove the slime and leave the houses ready to be renewed and rehabilitation.
We took tons and tons of dead fish, aesthetics, power of local factory.
We got excited and loved.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
You'll pick it up and bring them to different places of people around to store them.
It wasn't until then I realized that those photos represented a huge part of personal losses that people had suffered.
As they went out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a village assessment center.
He helped clean the global bathrooms, the huge, barbarian giant.
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the evaluation center picks photos.
There they were, and I had the honor that that day would trust me to wipe out the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the horizons, but it wasn't until I was spending my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at photos, I found some of them who were over a hundred years old, and they were still on the top of the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking how to fix that bath and repair that hole and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night came into Facebook with some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we had to try it.
So we started playing the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too steaming, but where the water had declared the face of the girl had to be fixed with a lot of precision and delicate.
Otherwise, that little girl wouldn't have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the spoiled photo.
At the time of time, they came up with more photos, and they needed more advocates, so that I went into Facebook and LinkedIn and five days later 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 willing people to join.
In Japan, in July, we mobilized to Christmas, a neighboring village in Northern Alabama.
Once a week we used our scanner in the temporal photographs that had been installed, where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time they took to deliver them is a different story, depending on the challenge of the picture of photos.
I could take an hour . I could make weeks.
It could make months.
This chimp had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and detail water hadn't destroyed.
It took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these pictures plunged in saltwater, covered with bacteria, with algae, even with oil, all of that together with the time time, still destroy them, so clean them by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't play the picture unless they were clean, dry and had been replaced by his owner.
We were lucky with cleaning by hand.
We count the guide of a nice neighbor.
It's very easy to hurt even more photos.
As Gwen once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky relative to photos.
I had started to wipe her out, but he stopped when he realized that I loved them even more.
It also had doubled.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been able to reconstruct, we were able to flap the images in a single picture and play the whole picture.
When he collected his photos shared something from his story with us.
A few colleagues in their husband found the photos in a bomb station between the rubble far away from where their house used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
On the day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter of pigs to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the Sirens sound.
His little kids, not so small now, but his two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her his photos her last 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could do, something that he could come back, something that could remember the past that wouldn't have been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them helped us to clean up more than 125 pictures the vast majority -- -- the vast majority came back to their owners . important.
Over 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 hundred and a half thousand photos of totally distributed and backward.
During this time, we really don't spend more than $1,000 in teams and materials, most of the printers.
We took pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, someone dear.
They're guards of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take, but the first thing we would look for.
This is what the project was, about restoring small pieces of humanity, to give someone the connection with the past.
When a picture like this is back to someone, it has a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of the speakers.
Some of them connected to something bigger, to give something bigger, using their talent for something that is not thin models of perfect skin.
To finish I'd like to read this email, I sent it Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I was playing, I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in images.
One particular one, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, gathered around a baby, was moved, because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter newborn, hangs from our wall.
In the entire world, in every few of our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.
Doc Leers inspired us awe awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that runs an apple in an exhibition of just a billionth of a second.
But now , 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present you a new kind of photography: the metabolic -- a new technique so fast that can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the corners, beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really challenges the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it up and turn it up in a sember of second or whether it is, in several residents to create a seat array of a millimeter.
And that package of photons, that bullet, traveling at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet.
If we take that bullet and we shot in this bottle, how do those photons dispersed within this bottle?
What is the aspect of light in slow motion?
Now, all of this -- remember that all of this is happening effectively in less than a donor, is what takes the light to travel.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola didn't take this research . There's a lot of things in this film, and I'm going to get this information to show you what's going on.
The pulse, our bullet, enters the bottle with a photons of photons that starts to catch, and inside, it starts to melt.
Some of the light goes off, goes to the table, and we started seeing these ripples.
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the reflection of the top, you see on the bottom of the bottle, after several frames, that the reflection is concentrated.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet, and we make it go back the same distance, and we see it in slow motion at about 10 billion times, how much do you think that would lead us to feel like that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring film of a molecule in motion.
And what about testing with dead nature?
You can see the waves that get rid of the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature painted a picture, thought, from a remix at a time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at one more time, this tomato, you'll notice that, as the light gets out of the tomato, it goes bright . It's not dark.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light bounces in its interior, and it comes back after several dimensions of the second.
In the future, when this seek is on its cell phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a low exposure, you get very little light.
But we're going to get a billion times faster than the shortest exposure, so I'll just enter some light.
We sent that bullet, that packet of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very sustained synchrony, we took those gigabytes of data and we put them computational to create those of them that I showed you.
We can take all of those raw data and process them in an interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a superhero future would allow you to see after the corners?
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, recorded, go into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light cells.
It's not science fiction . We've built it.
On the left, there's our marriage.
Behind the wall, there's a pack and we bounce light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Community.
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works that way of fast, our sexual shoulder has unique capacities.
It has very good temporal resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point it is.
When you project a laser, you can record a picture, which you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we'll put them together and try to analyze multiple light bounces, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in 3D?
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's going on on the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build able to be able to look at the inside of the body by picking up voices, and the same thing for microscopes.
But of course, because of tissue, and the blood this is pretty difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about the demographics as a new mindset of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation of the next generation.
As Doc Leening, he himself a scientist, turned science into art, an art of freedom photographs.
I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we collected are not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to be able.
Create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and colored code.
And look at those waves . Remember, time between each of those waves, it's just a few tensions of a second.
But here's something funny here.
If you look at the waves below the lid, these are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appear to the camera.
By applying the corresponding disease of space and time, we can correct this distortion.
It's time . Thank you.
Hi . This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can take a song, upload it to South Scottise and make famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a 1985, living guy in the city of Berlin.
Let's go back to that moment, this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were protesting in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989 . Imagine if all these people gathered that they're protesting for a change, they had a mobile phone.
Who are in the present here?
Get them away.
Raise your mobile phone.
Get back . A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot . Almost everyone today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about myself, from my mobile phone, and how life changed me.
So talk about this.
These are 35 million lines of information.
The raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U Commission, he presented a directive.
This is the Republic of Information.
This directive says that every European phone company, every European Internet, has to store a wide range of information of users.
Who calls whom . Who sends an email to who.
Who sends him a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, to two years, in their phone company or its Internet provider.
And across Europe, people stood up and said,``We don't want this.
They said they didn't want this database.
We want determination in the digital age, and we don't want the phone phones and the Internet providers store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said,``we don't want this.
And here you can see about ten thousand people coming out to the streets of Berlin and said,``Freedom, I don't fear.
And some even said this would be the 2.0 2.0.
The statistics was the secret police of Germany East.
And I also wondered if this works really.
Can you store all this information about us?
Any time I use your mobile phone?
So I asked my phone, Timothy Hello, who at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, which please sent me all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to them, and I didn't get a concrete answer . It was all blah, blah.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're progressing my life.
So I decided to show you a judicial lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But Timothy Hello said no, we won't give this information.
At the end, we signed an agreement.
I would remove the demand, and they would send me the information I asked.
Meanwhile, the Global constitutional tribunal failed the institutional law of the E.U's directive law.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand pounds of information.
At first I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge archive . Okay.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little skeptical: what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to come out.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what data retention means.
So, next to Keith Online and Open Data City, we did this.
This is a sexual visualization of my life.
You can zoom up and go back and go backwards and forwards.
You can see every step I give.
And you can see how I'm from Francisco in train to colony, and how often I call the journey.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just me.
But all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife, and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they're called each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this great network of communications.
You can see how your people communicate each other to what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who you talk to who, who's sent an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the Starrs would have known who involved in this protest, and if the statistics had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And in a consequence, neither of the iron curtain.
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and want to store them forever.
But determination and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for self-determination.
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not happening in fashion.
When you go home, tell your representatives that only because companies and state agencies can store certain information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call it New York and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions, to family the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so all the time.
Look.
It's exhausting . I'm like a screen.
And Muhammad Al.
La C. C. is not genetic.
It's not conflict, and it cannot contract.
Nobody molecules the uterus of my mother and I didn't catch it because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It just happens by accidents, like the one that happened to me when I was born.
Now, I warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they've been willing to be disabled.
Let's go from a walk.
Christmas Christmas, they're in the mall, drive in circles for parking and what do you see?
16 places for disabled.
And they think,``God, can I be at least a little disabled? ''
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and Dr. C is just one of them.
If there's a simplicity of oppression, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim, woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should.
I'm from Park Conference, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same principles.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I could.
Many people with cerebral palsy don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the``can't be . ''
The mantra of my father was,``You can . You can do it; dance sing . ''
If my three older sisters cleaned, I clean.
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents were sent to the school system, and they made sure that I was too, and if we didn't know all the whole note, we all received the sneakers of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at five years putting my pants on his feet and just walking.
Another tactics I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to pursue it.
The repetition I took inside was very strong and ...
Yeah . The first day in kindergarten was walking like a biomass champion that has received a lot of hits.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all the family.
There are now 20 Arabs now, and they're still all family . I think nobody realized that we were not Italian.
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think of using``hate Muslims"as a campaign.
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to worry about a lot to starve for hunger.
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so I'm going to help the dawn of dawn, and I'm very easy.
I walked in Broadway.
Yes, in Broadway . It's crazy . My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to dance school.
I learned to dance with heels, so I can walk with heels.
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be a girl, so if my friends were using heels, I also.
And when my friends were going to happen the summer vacation on the Jersey coast, I wasn't.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we didn't go back to Palestine every summer, we would become Madonna.
In summer summer summer, my father was trying to get me up, so I drink milk milk, put me warm cups on my back, I was diving in the Dead Sea, and I remember that the water burned my eyes and I thought,``works, it works! . ''
But the miracle cure was the yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before doing yoga was a superconducting comedian that couldn't stand up.
And now I can hold in your head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at General Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a scholarship for the United States, University of the state of Arizona, because I went into all the questions.
It was like the pet department of theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I did all of the least intelligent tasks, I took the maximum note in my classes, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the crystal zoo, my teachers cried.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the ALS decided to do a work called Dance very slowly in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy.
I was a girl with cerebral palsy.
So I started screaming at four winds,``I'll have a role!
I have cerebral palsy!
Stop free! At the end.
Thank God Almighty, I'm free . ''
I didn't get paper . They gave it to Jerry Brown.
I went to play with the theater department director, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask him why, and she told me that because they believed I couldn't do the risk stunts.
And I said,``Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts, you can't do the character . ''
It was a role for which I literally had been born and gave it to an actress without cerebral palsy.
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a second story of adding actors without disabilities for disabled papers.
When I graduated, I went home, and my first tour tour was kind of an extra phone.
My dream became reality.
And I knew it would be a seat of``better crazy friend"in a saint.
Instead, I was there like a vase, I didn't see more than the swim, and it was obvious to me that the elite directors didn't hire fat actors, not white, with disability.
They only hired perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Christopher Goldberg, Rail Carolina, Ellen, and all these women had one thing in common: they were comedians.
So I got humor.
In my first tour, I took famous comedy from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comic that I took when I fell on the realization that I was going high through the New Jersey freeway with a driver that had cerebral palsy.
I worked in clubs from all the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and without a veil.
Some people say I'm the first monitoring of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty buzz that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my mother from another mother and father, Dean Florida, and I launched the New York New York City Festival Festival, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the indigenous in media, and at the same time remembering the report directors that South Asia and Arabic are not synonymous.
And integrating Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the cable news program, which is back with Keith Brown.
I walked into a graduate dance, and I was dragged to a studio and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said,``Excuse me, can you give me another chair? ''
She looked at me and said,``Five, four, three, two . ''
And we were live.
So I was clinging to the desk of the presenter to not get out of the screen during the segment, and when I finished the interview, I was pale.
At the end, I had my opportunity and I turned it out . I knew they wouldn't invite me.
But not only Mr. Brown came back to me, but I was a full-time participants and pasted my chair.
One thing that I learned in direct with Keith Burrough was that people on the Internet are Scotland.
The kids are cruel, but they never got fun of me or a little girl.
Suddenly my Internet disability became an object of ridicule.
I saw online clips with comments like,``Why do you shake?
\" Is it withdrawn? ''
And my favorite,``poor terrorist.
What disease has it?
We should really hear about it . ''
A reviewer suggested even to add my disability to my rsum: lust, comedian, paralyzed.
And disability is as visual as race.
If someone in wheelchair can't do from Skype, then jihad can't make someone in a wheelchair.
The disabled is the -- yeah, clap, man . Come on.
The disabled is the largest minority in the world, and the most represented in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I wouldn't walk, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think it was.
I hope that together we could create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children well.
My laptop journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to walk through the red carpet called by the pick of the Selance Line Levin and the British Court Court.
I came to act on a film with Adam Sandon and working with my idol, the incredible Daniel Matthew.
I went around the world,``Arabs have become crazy . ''
I was deployed in representation of the great state of New Jersey in 2008.
And I founded``The Children of May ,"a charity charity to give kids Palestinian refugee a part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I dedicated this talk to his memory.
Saddiet, Dad.
I call it New York, and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small village.
I don't know your name, but I know his story.
It lives in a small village to the South of Somalia.
This village is near Mogadishu.
The drought drives the small village to poverty and the edge of the sentence.
Without anything, it goes to the great city, in this case, Marketing, the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there's no opportunity, no work, no future perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside of Mogadishu.
After maybe a funny year, nothing.
One day you read a gentleman who offers him to take him to lunch, after dinner, to breakfast.
He knows a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little money to buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They introduce a young woman.
You finally get married.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Mogadishu, under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That child from that little village with dreams of the great quality was suicide bombers, and that dynamic group of people were al San, a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how is the story of a little boy, trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him dancing?
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he came.
This was the first thing that's taken out of what we call``the period of waiting . ''
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the marginalized, young urban urban young people who are destroying riots in Johannesburg, department in London, who seek something beyond the``waiting period . ''
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of opportunity, of work, of well-being, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
Often it's the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the history of the``waiting period ,"the door of access to terrorism, violence, gangs, being the story of 2.0.
And in my hometown, Mogadishu , 70 percent of young people unemployed.
70 percent don't work, don't go to school.
They don't do virtually anything.
I went back to Mogadishu last month, and I went to visit the Nazi Hospital, the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in that hospital banned to whales thinking,``And if I'd never gone? ''
What if I had been forced to be in that same``waiting period? ''
Would I have become terrorist?
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in Mogadishu that month was actually to support a few juvenile leaders in a business.
I met about 90 Somali youth leaders.
We sat down and had a brainstorming of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was Adam.
He went to Mogadishu University, graduated.
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he told me, because it was a graduate college, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for al Shabaab and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Mogadishu, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B are the streets.
Twenty years of civil war have completely destroyed the visual system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize.
And they saw an opportunity and he caught it.
He started a motorcycle company.
He started beating motorcycles to local residents who normally couldn't buy them.
I bought 10 motorbikes, with his family's help and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of engines over the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What makes this story different?
I think that its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the``waiting period . ''
It empowers young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so desperately.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed Mountain, a flower.
I was helping to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiatives and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiatives.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mogadishu has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your wedding, you used to be plastic from the foreigner.
If you asked someone,``when was the last time you saw fresh flowers?
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be,``Never . ''
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a profit company and a flower design.
I created a farm outside of Mogadishu, and he started growing beans and neighborhoods, which said, could survive the weather of Mogadishu.
And he started the delivery of flowers for weddings, creating gardens in houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in Mogadishu in 22 years.
There are no public parks in Mogadishu.
He wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial rose.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, Mohamed's presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
I forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
I encouraged you to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, which could be interpretation of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They set corporate solutions for local problems.
So inspired young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but the young people need capital to do their ideas.
They need expertise and guidance to guide them in development and put their business.
They connect the young people with the resources that they need, to give them the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Peace Park, that's how it calls it, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
They're looking at kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorbikes for him.
I gave them the opportunity to escape from the``waiting period . ''
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: convert young people in entrepreneurs, they find and feeding their inherent innovation, and they'll have more stories about flowers and Peace parks than rockets and``waiting periods . ''
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to camping with my dad on the Barnes Mountains, an air area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The sales forest.
The sun made the leaves glow like a virtual, and not being the way that we follow, we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to put that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a shed in a record with a beautiful crystal lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed, there was a garbage, about four square feet with apple heart balls of aluminum paper, and old enough.
And I was honored, I was very angry and incredibly confused.
The campaigns that were too lazy to pull out what they had brought, who thought was going to clean their garbage?
That question went on with me, and it's a little simplified.
Who clean our trash?
No matter how you organize or where they put the``ours ,"who clean our trash in Istanbul?
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in London?
Here in New York, the Department of Health clean our trash, in order of 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
How do you feel to use the uniform and take that load?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their trajectories and interviewed people in office and facility in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an intruder.
I needed to get further.
So I started working as a garbage officer.
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks . I drive them.
And he operated the mechanical interviews and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as they believe, and in the days that it's very strong to be used quickly.
It costs a lot of subjective to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies continued to adjust the weight of carrying on their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, waste collection is one of 10 most dangerous occupation in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass around you.
They just want to happen, so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the worker.
And also the trash itself is filled with dangers that often fall out of the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the complexity of garbage.
When you get out of the bed and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
He never stopped coming.
It's also like a form of breath or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And there's the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that waste collectors are the most important workforce in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first public health producers.
If you don't get rid of the waste in effective and effective ways every day, this starts to get rid of their container and their inherent dangers, they threaten us in very real ways.
diseases that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to collapse and start giving us.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy start to fail when the consumption is in danger.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just his relationship.
And then there's what I call our average day speed.
I mean, I mean simply to the speed that we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't worry, we don't repair, we clean or we carry our coffee cup, our bag bag, our water bottle.
We use them, we throw them down, we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that will be made.
So today I want to suggest a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and include them in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost tragic.
They're on the street every day, wirelessly.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to wait.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us out of ourselves, from our own waste, our waste, and that flow should always stay one way or another.
On one day after 9/11, I heard the graduate from a waste collection truck on the street, grabbed my little kid and dropped the stairs running, and there was a man doing his paper recycled journey as he did all the Wednesday Wednesday.
And I tried to thank him to do that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and he just nodded, and he said,``We're going to be okay.
We're going to be fine . ''
Shortly after that, I started investigating the waste collection, and I went back to see that man.
It's called Paul, we worked together, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to figure out how we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have in account all costs, even the very real human cost of the labor labor.
The municipal waste, what we think when we talk about garbage, represents three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic.
So in the flow of his days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean the garbage of you, take a moment to recognize them.
Take a moment to tell you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community's life being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become a essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping mall of a series in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa.
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was,``I want to go running.
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to rescue.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crystals with crystals generates heat inside, so it's very cooling.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third, its aspect has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a shame that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really involved with the old market that is this open-air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little marketers.
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, several floors, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented by reflecting the site, which is located in a very growth area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image are not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the entries of the building.
And this spreads with an inclusive atrium that creates a space to the open air in the building that is protecting, by its own shape, the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responded to local climate conditions.
And I got to think of a tissue that's similar to an ant shell with punctures to allow the input from the air, and also light, but in a filter way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of the dresses of the stages.
They have fractal geometry properties, and this helped me model the facade.
We're building that with these little ready-made pieces that are the windows that let pass air and light in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is implemented with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas, it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought,``That's not a mall . It wasn't what we asked . ''
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the shopping center because at the end of there there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic, not only because of the material compared to glass, but also because it didn't need to have any air conditioning.
So we get certain savings savings that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy supply for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting southern sketches on the roof.
And then under those panels, we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these holes on the roof, which in the roof collect water for indoor health.
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we're going through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest one that I've designed, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in medicine, a 10,000 years structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these courtyards.
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project, like apartment, as a essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the Mediterranean climate?
And it's North, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we have a scheme that makes sure that most apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and Arab city.
It has these pathologists with courtyards, and then in the plant, we have all the connections for pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make greater density in higher levels and a minor density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost how to bring the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and search, and make activities like running a mile race in the morning, or jumping from one building to another.
These two examples have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but affordable solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new child entered our class . It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright amounts of hair, and a little bit of pencils, cute . I was super strong for the state capitals, very good for reference.
I ended that year and I was full of jealousy, until I brought my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after the school out of school . It was a little late, and I hid into the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was cleared, I walked out, entered the classroom, took from my teacher's table, the book of grades.
And then I did.
I altered the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit, just some like this.
All of them like this . And I used to give back the book to the drawer, but to see, some of my other partners had very good grades too.
So in a frenzy, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of you and myself a row of this, just for being there, because I could ...
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never caught me.
It was all destroyed.
They never discovered me.
But most of all, I was reminded the reason why I was bothered that this little girl, so small, was so good for photography.
I'm intrigued to jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so resilient.
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also primates . The blue birds are very likely.
We know that cells are the number one number of coloring killings in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that looks at loneliness, or long duration or sadness.
So, you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the laboratory where the cells are studied in all their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no jealousy, there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no Helen the infinite, there would be no```` Odysseus . ''
There would be no color king, no```` The thousand and a night . ''
There would be no Shakespeare.
They disappear high school lists in high school, because we would be losing``The Noise and the Moon ,"there would be no``````Station"or``Ethiopia . ''
Without jealousy, there's no Project . I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost it's got them all.
This year, a hundred years of his masterpiece,```` In search of the lost time ,"the most comprehensive study of sexual cells and also about ordinary competitiveness, mine, everything we could have . And thinking about Proust, we have the details, right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a humanoid marriage in your lava.
We forget how hard that image is.
We forget how amazing it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia Roosevelt said was as tough as a cat of cat.
I don't know what the cat is, but we assume it's luck.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the jealousy, the jealousy and Project.
It's going to be very obvious like the jealousy, who reduces the person, their desire, to their impediments, are a very solid narrative basis?
I don't know . I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being both storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to include, to wash the knife, right?
The jealousy causes all of amateur novelists, and that's something I tried to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give him pleasure, maybe right now . ''
And he starts to tell himself that story, and since then, Proust says that every French charm that Stanley lies on his lover, he adds him to his collection of tortured instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Evan and Proust were notoriously jealous.
You know, the Princeton's boyfriend would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so jealous to recognize that it's hard work . Right?
Celebrations are exhausting.
It's a hungry emotion . You have to feed it.
And how are the jealousy jealousy?
The jealousy jealousy cells.
The jealousy cells use the details.
The jealousy likes the big amounts of bright hair and the cute and small wind.
The jealousy jealousy crashes.
That's why Instagram is so successful, it's so successful, and it's so successful, the language of the language of the climate.
When Ivan is in his jealousy agony, suddenly listening behind the doors and bribe to the survivors of his lover, then defending those behaviors.
He says,``Look, I know you think that this is disgusting, but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or looking at a memorial.
He says,``are scientific research with real intellectual value.
Now, I'm trying to show that the cells look awful and make us seem absurd, but in their mind, they are search for knowledge, search of the truth, a painful truth . In fact, the more painful the truth, the more painful.
Pain, humiliation, loss: These were the pathways to the Professor's wisdom.
He says,``A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, causes us a range of very profound and vital feelings than a man who can be interested in . ''
Are we telling us that we're going to look for cruel women?
No . I think it's trying to say that the jealousy colleagues reveal us.
And is there any other emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion to us, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at such peculiar intensity?
Freud writing about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very restless young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife was fooled.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, who didn't look at what his wife did.
Well she was innocent; everybody knew it.
The poor creature was low without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did, without realizing, involuntary behaviors.
Is it going to be too much, or do you get married with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the challenge of his wife's unconscious.
The novels are very good at this.
The novels describe very well how the jealousy ones make us look intense but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the jealousy is taking us to make violent acts or illegal acts.
The jealousy consumers drive us to behave in completely unimaginable ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself when I was eight, I recognize it, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michael aged 52 was captured for having created a fake account in Facebook since the one who was sent up, horrible, himself, for a year.
For a year . A year.
She was trying to match the new girlfriend of her childhood . I have to confess that when or this, they react with admiration.
Because, let's be realistic.
What enormous, although unfortunate, creativity . Right?
It's like novel.
It's a novel of Patricia Higgs.
Higgs is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of``strangers in a train, and``The talents Mr. Park ,"books that treat how the jealousy, confused our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be punched in an instant.
Let's take Tom Pierram, his most famous character.
Tom Rise's going to want me or want what you have to get away from your self and try to get out of what you ever had, and you're under the floor . You respond to your name, take your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom Pierram.
I can't give you around the world, as much as I would like.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in time.
I mean, are we good citizens of social networks, where is the currency? Right?
Are the novels show us? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the 2012 of Baker Street and ask for Mosoline Homos.
When people think about Monologue, think about the curse of the Martin Professor, that criminal genius.
But I've always preferred [to Prince] Lester, the head of Street de rat of South Korea who needs Thomas desperately, needs the genome of Thomas, but he's annoyed.
Oh, it sounds so familiar.
Lestine needs his help, but the present, and he survives with bitterness in the every single mystery.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in```` The September of The Six Bellinking ,"once Homo comes in, she volunteers to everybody with his solution, Lester comes to Monolia and says,``We're not jealous, Mr. Holocaus.
We're proud of you . ''
And he tells him that there's no one person in Sputnik, who didn't want to fix your hand.
It's one of the few times we see Harold shown in history . It seems to me this very emotional . That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat cells as a geometry problem, without emotion.
You know, in a minute Homo is the opposite side of Lester.
The next minute they are the same side.
All of a sudden, Lester is allowed to admire that idea of being him.
Could it still be so simple?
What if cells are really a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to be relative to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to resist the greatness of the other.
We can align with it.
But I like the emergency plans.
So as we wait for that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction to comfort them.
Just the fiction of the jealousy.
The fiction used the domesticated, invites them to the table.
And look at what clustering: the sweet Lewis, the lander Tom Pierram, the Turkey nuts, the same Marcel Project.
We're at great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 , 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the Apollo 11, and he went up on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface gray was the culmination of a conventional collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization in peace in America.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including Apollo 1 crew.
But before the Apollo Apollo program , 24 men traveled to the moon.
Twelve walk on their surface, that Karama after death of Armstrong last year is now the oldest.
So why were they?
They didn't bring a lot of back : 38 pounds of old rock rocks, and something that 24 would emphasize later, a new sense of the small and fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets, that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in 1962, they give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy: Some questions, why the moon?
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would you scale the highest mountain?
35 years ago, why would you fly about the Atlantic?
Why is Rice versus Texas?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason 2: For the contemporaries, Apollo was not just a West victory on the east in the Cold War.
In the time, the strongest emotion was to wonder about the transcendence of the power of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological triumph.
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of assembly and airplane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the polio is eradicated and smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Gandhi Fortune was in 1970 called``activist force . ''
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a sailing boat, but in 1969, the Apollo's crew , 10 miles or hour.
Since 1970, no human has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than Apollo 10 crew, and the optimism joy about the power of technology has been evaporated by seeing that problems that we imagine that technology will solve as going to Mars, create clean energy, or feeding the world population, seem to be intractable.
I remember looking at the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he didn't look at the escape tube calling the Saturn V rocket.
I knew enough that this would be the last thing, but I was absolutely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that said,``Something happened to our ability to solve problems with technology ,"has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have destroyed us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhone, apps and social networks, or algorithms that accelerate the automated sale.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's a partial explanation in Silicon Valley, which means that they've created less ambitious companies than the years in which Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Heaven.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete, the incentives of risk capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that risk investment caused us to change the creation of transformational ideas by the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their side, without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
The crows have always had problems to invest with technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term . They've never invested in developing technologies that are meant to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and curious -- less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic.
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the control.
We want alternative energy sources that can compete in price . Don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties will incentivize development of alternative energy, mostly, a significant increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of control of coal price.
But there is no hope in the political climate today that we will see a U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out not to be.
We know from the time that famine are turned out of failure in the food store.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famine is political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and food repair, but there will be famine while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes lead a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the cancer war in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resilient to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have to be present: political leaders and population must want to solve the problem; institutions have to support the solution; it must really be a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission, which has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, meets those criteria.
But it's a disruptive model in the future.
We're not in 1961.
There's no profit competition like in the Cold War, there's not a politician like John Kennedy who hurt the hard and the dangerous, and there's no popular science mythology of exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was only three days.
And it really wasn't even solving any problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't lack the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the generalized ideas that have about trust.
They are so common that they have become cliche of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a remix: there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third is a task: we should recover trust.
I think that the recognition, the goal and the task is wrong.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a cliff, a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea on the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has decreased?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I encourage to think that it may have declined in some activities or institutions, and that might have increased in others.
I don't have clear.
But I can go back to the opinion polls, and the views of opinion are supposedly the source of belief that trust has declined.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there aren't many evidence of that.
I mean, the people who discovered 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they continue to inspire the same mistrust.
And the people who were very trustworthy about 20 years ago remain pretty reliable: judges, nurses.
The rest is in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway halfway.
But is this enough evidence?
What the opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you register?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they're asked certain questions.
Confident in politicians? Trust in teachers?
Now, if someone would ask you,``Did you trust the virtues?
Did you trust the fishermen?
Did you trust the primary teachers? ''
You would probably start to ask:``to do what?
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question,``Well, I trust in some of them, but in others.
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust differently.
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain kind of official, functional, or kind of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I rely on a certain primary teacher that I know to give the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good driver.
I could trust my friend more crazy to keep a conversation, but not, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is difficult, why do we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in the most abstract way?
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence, because they try to make the good judgment inherent in the fact of trusting something or in somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I would pursue.
I would encourage to have more confidence in what's a trust market, but not what it is not.
Ultimately, I'm a part of not trust what's not reliable.
And I think that those people who decided their savings with the very appropriately named Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, I think about them, and I think, well, they were too confident.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Performing confidence or denied with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say that, he says, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about making a judgment about how trustworthy people are in certain respects.
And I think that in order to make a judgment, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they responsible?
And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but they don't trust them to bring a letter to the mail, because they're forgotten.
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they overestimate their own competence.
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have many friends who are competent and responsible but extremely dishonest.
If it's like that, I still haven't noticed myself.
But that's what we're looking for: trustworthiness before they trust.
The trust is the answer.
trustworthiness is what we have to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party, and he said,``Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper than to attend the word itself . ''
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional, that the accountability system that's destined to guarantee trustworthiness and evidence tests, actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is to tell the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like the parties, demanding that``marks the box ,"as we say.
I'm sure you all know similar examples.
Everything, all of that, for the goal.
I think the goal should be more trustworthiness, and that things would be different if we try to be worthy of trust, and we would provide people that we are trustworthy and if we try to determine whether other people, functional or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy . It's judgment, simple actions, attitudes, which is not done properly.
Third, task.
To call the task rebuild trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, in the bottom, is distinctive because we're saving other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given.
You have to give them the enough foundation so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't cheat, usually, all the people, all the time.
But you also have to deliver evidence evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do we do it?
That's done every day, everywhere, do ordinary people, the officials, the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks, says I can give you no explanation.
I take them and give me the money, or I'm changing them for the color that I want.
That's great . I rely on them because they were vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust on what you're saying.
So, at the end, I think what we're pointing is not really hard to figure out.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers, we've come to strive to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be broken.
This separation has been reducing, increasingly and more, to such point that today is less than one millimeter, the glass of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, if there were no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
I first created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong possibility against the screen transfers its physical body to pixels.
Designers can kill their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, the barriers are broken.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of hands?
In the division of applying Sciences from Microsoft, along with my mentor Catagor Blood, I wrote the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
By combining a transparent bombsight with cameras of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift your hands from the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have an location in real space, choosing them is as easy as taking a book from a shelf.
You can pick up the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual sound sensor that's below every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we are in the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
Surely, many of us will have bought and round things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual trial for the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or translucent when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physical so that we can touch them and feel them?
What would a future be like that?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Sweden and my collaborator King Stephen, we created this only physical pixel.
This business magnet behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
So simplify, what we did was we encourage gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation, mechanical and detectors.
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can be recorded and reproduce and stay forever in the physical world.
You can teach physically, physically, and the famous shot of Michael Jordan can reproduce as a physical reality for the times we wanted.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel . It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not just show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without having to be disconnected from our world.
We started today talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a raging for two years in Hungary, China, in the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer to a school for athletes with all expenses.
But my mother tiger said,``No.
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed that there was only a close path towards happiness: a safe and recorded work.
No matter if the job would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese singer.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A singer singer must begin to train from very young to learn the arts, so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the school director and a radio program.
But no adults, I added the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends were supporting me, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15, I knew it was too much bigger to train.
My dream will never be done.
I feared, for the rest of my life, a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved for another calling.
No one around me wanted to teach me? Okay.
I remember books.
[" Four Exploration .") (`` The History of History") And I got to America in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
\" The Great Earth"is about Chinese medical life.
And it's not very convenient . I understood.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a revelation:``honor your father and mother . ''
\" honoring ,"I said .``it's so different, and much better than obey . ''
So it became my tool to come out of this confusing trap trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my own comparative reading habit.
I've got a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me outside because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
Compare and contrast, it offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked to research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can treat people [`` Benjamin Franklin"from Walter School'``John Adams"] that they were involved in a process, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Christ, the temptation is economic, political and spiritual.
For the Buddha, they're all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
[" The Road of Bank Tzu") (`` The Road of Simplicity"Alan Projects instead of losing me in translation, found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it's through translation that I realized that``happiness"in Chinese literally means``quick joy ."Ha!
And``girlfriend"in Chinese, literally means``new mother . ''
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I won't feel lonely or impotent.
Having a destroyed dream really isn't compared to what many others have suffered.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a destroying dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always accompanied them.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychotherapy client.
I was a doctor in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a 23-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a hotel guy, threw in the couch of my office, took the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so relieved.
My classmates had a permit as a first client.
And I got a little girl that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to sessions, it became easy to just move the head as we were delayed by the solution.
\" The 31 are the new 20s ,"he said Alex, and so I saw, she was right.
You start working later, you get married after, you have children later, to death after.
For veterans like Alex, and I was a time.
But shortly after, my supervisor pushed me to press Alex to talk about his loving life.
I was resistant.
I said,``Of course, he's coming up with the guys under your category, it goes into a head, but it's not like it was to marry him . ''
And then my supervisor said,``Not yet, but maybe you get married with the next one.
In addition, the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before you get married . ''
This is what psychologists call a``Aha! ''
It was when I realized that the '30s are not the new 20.
Yes, people feel head after what was used to, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the 20,000 of Alex were the perfect time, and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this kind of benign neglect was a real problem and had real consequences, not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of veterans everywhere.
There are 50 million readers in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you consider no one comes to adulthood without passing before by the 1950s.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20s.
I want to see the gentlemen here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with windows, you love a piano, take your dream off a glass, I want to see . It's fine . Incredible, you really care.
This is not just my opinion . These are facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at the age of 35.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments,``Aha!"which shape his life will have happened for when they're 30 and so many.
People from over 40, they don't panic in panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money they gain.
We know that over half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future in the age of 30.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20s, and it's programming for adulthood, which means that if there's something you want to change from yourself, it's now the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20s than in any other moment of life, and we know that female fertility comes to its time at 28, and things become complicated at 35.
The 20 are the time to educate on their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your daily life and common has an impact on the person who will become.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development, and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the pixels are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the timeline of adulthood.
The researchers call the 20 an extended adolescence.
journalists are coined by the journalists, like``Timbers"and``declines . ''
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a triviality that's actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Bernstein said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when they give you a pat in your head and say,``Do you have another 10 years to start your life? ''
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and their ambition and doesn't happen absolutely anything.
And then every day, intelligent representatives, interesting like you or your kids and children come to my office and say something like this:``I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count . I'm just killing time . ''
Or they say,``Everybody says that as long as you start a career before 30, everything will be fine . ''
But then he starts to sound something like this:``My 20 are for finishing, and I still have nothing to show.
I had better curriculum the day I graduated from college . ''
And then it starts to sound like this:``my quotes during the 20 were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and fun, but then at some point around 30, the music took off and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I was 30 . ''
Where are the calves here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but you don't get wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 1930s, there's a huge pressure to the lands and so many of you to start a race, choose a city, choose a partner, and have two or three children in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are not compatible, and there are research that begin to show, which is much more difficult and so stressful to do everything from once at the age of 30.
The middle aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
Many lands and careers look themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their 20,``What was I doing? What was I thinking? ''
I want to change what the calves are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At the age of 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he'd like to work in art or entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a prisoner.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that was more temporary than ambition.
And even though we live about 20 very difficult, their previous life had been even harder.
He cried often in our sessions, but then she held up her by saying,``You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends . ''
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost all the hour.
I had just bought a new book for director, and I had spent all the morning with his many contacts, but then he was seeing the empty space that follows after the words``In case of emergency, please call to...''
I was at the point of the story when he saw me and said,``Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident?
Who's going to take care of me if I give cancer? ''
At that time, I was very hard to resist and not say,``Aye . ''
What Emma needed was not a therapy that really cares.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit down while the decisive decade of Emma went ahead.
So over the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every pixel, man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma to forget about that identity crisis and get identity capital.
For capital capital, I mean doing something that add value to his person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of Emma's career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that interior, of that company that you want to try.
I'm not tearing the exploration of exploration, I'm tearing the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration.
It's an artist.
I told Emma to explore jobs and made them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are saved.
The best friends are great to take the airport, but the gentlemen who join with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who they know, what they know, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always comes from their nearest circle.
The new things come from what's called weak values friends of friends.
Yes, half of the pixels have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and weak ties are the form of color to this group.
Half of the jobs created never published, then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job.
It's not cheating . It's the science of how information happens.
Last but not least, Emma thinks you don't choose your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing, but as a veteran, I fell soon to choose his family, when he has a couple and his own family.
I told Emma the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to feel like 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you're living with now or you're following now when everyone in Facebook start walking towards the altar is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means being as intentional in love as you are at work.
To choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with whoever you choose to you.
So what about Emma?
Well, we looked at that director, and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked on a art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job there.
That work offer a reason to leave the boyfriend that I lived with.
Now, five years later, it's special organized of events in museums.
This house with a man who chose consciously.
She loves his new career, she loves his new family, and I sent a letter to say,``now the emergency contact spaces are not big enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with windows.
It's very easy to help them.
The windows are like airplanes coming out of the Los Angeles airport, which come out somewhere from the west.
Just before the takeoff, a slight adjustments on its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Fiji.
In the same way, at 21 or 25, even 29, a good conversation, a good challenge, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea of spreading all the characters that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
That's what I've got the privilege of telling readers like Emma every single day: The '30s are not the new 20, they'll remember their adult, they get identity capital, they use their weak ties, they choose your family.
They're not allowed to define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: the distinction.
I went to teach them mathematics to seventh grade students in New York public schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
You give them tasks.
When the work came back, I calculated the grades.
What struck me was the I.Q . wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have IQ scores.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kinds of things you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, are difficult: proportions, digital, the area of a parallelogram.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it.
It's the Chris, but what if to succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick and easy way?
So I left the classrooms and went to college to become psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of challenging scenarios, and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the military West Side Point.
We tried to predict what highways would remain in military training and who they would retire.
We went to the National National competition, and we tried to predict what children would move as far as possible in the competition.
We studied innovative teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking what teachers still are going to be teaching for the end of the school year and of those, who will be the most effective to improve the learning outcomes of their students?
We partnered with private companies, asking, what about these marketers are going to maintain their jobs?
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came out a feature as a major predictor of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good appearance, the physical health and was not the C.
It was determination.
The determination is passion and perseverance to reach very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to do that future one reality.
The determination is to live life as if it's a marathon, not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who were doing my determination questionnaires and then waited for over a year to see who they graduated.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance to graduate, even when I put them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized tests, even the safety that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or at the National Forest competition in which it matters the determination . It's also in school, especially for children in risk of abandoning it.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, the little thing that science knows about their development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me,``How do you develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethic ethic?
How do you keep them motivated for the long term? ''
The most honest answer is: I don't know . What I know is that talent doesn't give them determination.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that simply don't go ahead with their commitments.
In fact, in our data, determination is often not related or even related to talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called growth mindset.
This is an idea developed at Stanford University, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with effort.
Dr. Red has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to challenge, they are much more likely to pursue when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions, and we need to test them.
We need to measure if they've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, wrong, to start everything again with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more determined.
Thank you.
Growing in Taiwan like the daughter of a cartoon, one of my most frightening memories is my mother showing beauty, shape and figure of Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I wonder for this incredible language.
But for an foreigners, it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall China.
And in the last few years, I've been wondering if I can melt this wall, so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day over the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic understood 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read traffic signals, menus menus, understand the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
People.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was screaming in a remarkable way,``Buddhist!! I'm burning!"This symbol is actually origin of the way I call it, but I like to believe it's the other way . The one that works.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of doors in the old West.
I call these eight characters radical.
They're building blocks to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's``to follow . ''
As the old adage says, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person would stretch their arms, this person is saying,``was that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
It's a prisoner, just like Jonas inside the whale.
A tree is a tree . Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a board under the tree, we have the foundations.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a``idiot"-- easy to remember, because a permanent tree is quite idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two fires together, it becomes very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of calls.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burning.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, prosperous.
Three together, those are flashes.
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the brightness.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door . Put a board inside the door, that's the door of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Did you touch, played somebody at home?
This person is coming out of a door, climbing, educating.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing.
Three women together, they have care about it.
So we've gone through nearly 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of characters, which is the same as a 100 year-old Chinese.
So after I met the characters, we started creating phrases.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a fire mountain . It's a volcano.
We know that Japan is the land of the national sun.
This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan is east in China.
So a sun next to the origin, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese employers destroyed their political enemies beyond mountains.
Today, exile has become coming out.
A mouth that tells you where to get out is a exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and lower from the stage . Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I come to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four, we saw the Wizard of Oz together.
The film dominated his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Greenland, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and carrying a magic wand.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We're now living and raised our children in a kind of a child's fantasy show.
However, Oz's magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took up a hundred years later with, interestingly, another film whose protagonist, a metal kid and a hairy guy rescued a girl dressed as a guard of enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about? Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the Wizard of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Wizard of Oz.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the apples.
But I think if the Oz magician was done today, the magician would say,``Dorothy, you're the West salvation as the prophecy predicted.
You use magic shoes to defeat the military computer-generated army computers.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician magician is that the most heroic, wiser characters are women.
I started noticing this when I made Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of survival had gone down, so he got stuck in the room, and he was impressed as a mom legs with his legs behind, and I didn't think he would understand what happened, but, luckily, he was absorbing everything.
I wonder what I perceive.
Would you be value issues, perseverance and loyalty?
Would you have the feeling that Luke joins an army to defeat government?
Let's compare this with the Wizard of 1939.
How does Dorothy win his film?
And doing good friends with everyone and being a leader.
It's the kind of world I want my kids to grow, OK? And not a world of men who are struggling, which is where we are.
Why is it so much heart capital force, force in the movies for our children, and so little like yellow bricks?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in girls, and they should read it . It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know by experience that the financial princess didn't provide the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults that's blended . I think at the moment of the first kiss, I really hoped that credit would start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has finished, I have girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat the villain and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are many exceptions, and defend the princess of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, kids, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend the patriarchy, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patriarchy.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and Brazilian as heroin and Rawls, but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all time continues to appear in classic after classic, each of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who wanted a girl.
Until, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out courageous.
I recommend it to all of you . It's available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when he came out?
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film from a princess.
It's very good . Don't let it stop you!
Well, almost none of these movies passes the Beijing test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's not yet failed and spread, but maybe we'll start a movement.
They're a comic picture, and in the mid-'80s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend about the evaluation of films that they saw.
And it's very simple . There are only three questions that you have to do: In the movie, there's more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
Are these women talking to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid that you like? Okay? Thank you . Thank you . Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things between themselves.
It happens . I've seen it, and yet I really rarely see it in the film we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality of quality, Argentina.
Right? rumors of Oscar, success success, a sense of consensus of what a Hollywood film is.
Pretty much, it doesn't happen the Beijing test.
And I don't think I should, because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the hostage crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this hide, and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say,``You come to bed, honey? ''
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 most popular films, how many of them think they have female protagonists?
No . It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's a bigger number than this one who's going to disappoint this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually assaulted ever in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think the videos of music or pornography are closely linked, but something bad, and when I hear that statistic, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual sex.
Who are those guys? What are they learning?
What don't you get to learn?
Are you looking at the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the villain with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and doesn't speak?
Are we looking at that story?
You know, as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to prepare them.
We have tools to our disposal as a force, and we hope that it helps, but I have to ask, but I have to ask, can I turn it up, if, at the same time, active or passively, are we educating our children to keep their male power?
I mean, I think that the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly to parents.
I think we have to show our children, a new definition of shoulder.
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the wages.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was from Star Wars know what he replied?
Flow.
They tested Kong and Greenland.
What do these two have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which I tell my son: Go and fight alone and more stories where you see that his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the magician of Oz.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine and one of the things I loved most was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these shells.
They're covered with sand, and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I used to look for them.
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them.
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the archaeology.
And finally when I started studying physical, I realized that I saw my own eyes was not enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1,300 miles of length alongside the Nile.
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to do otherwise.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared.
This is a place in the eastern East Egypt called Hindu.
And the place, at the naked view, seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink pink.
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of landscape caused by building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptians.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an old Egyptian city, called Chash, lost for thousands of years.
Star was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the average Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in El Francisco, Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The epidemiologists have always known that MT was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that built them, indicated inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge aluminum level.
This area is enormous, it's about 6.5 miles away.
Before, the Nile flows right next to State and as it changed over time, he was transferred to the east and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a single city in an alien landscape?
I'm going to try to find it randomly to be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a haystack, with the blindfolded eyes and using baseball gloves.
So, we use NASA imaging data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the Nile flow.
But you can see more detail, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside of the circle here, which we think might be the location of Costa.
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing show work; you can see here.
When I say a show, it's like the footage shots in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for human occupation layers.
Five meters down, below a thick layer of slime, we found a dense layer of ceramic objects.
This means that in this possible location of Country, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years that comes out of the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think it is Mountain.
We also find a job of stone, Korean, quartz and cat, which shows that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the Middle Empire jewelry, these are the stones that were used.
So, we've got a dense layer of occupation that comes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what's been there, was a very important city.
We don't find Chape here, but we'll go back to the place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Media Empire, probably written in Italy 4,000 years ago.
sharing knowledge is most of all the vacation.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So, apparently, TED was not founded in 1984.
Now, they make ideas happen actually started in 1984, C in a lost city not for a long time and found from high.
It certainly puts the search of marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that he's made.
Now you visualize a group of obese obese obese.
They're competing in a national network of bicycles and they go in direction to their entry door.
I need you to see this really.
They're getting strong, they're sweating, they're getting a lot.
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that pass on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in absurd places . They go the threshold of the door.
The lobby, the hallway, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, light light on the monster of the crackers.
He's waving them with your hand hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks.
You can feel your blue fur by doing them in the nose.
You can smell the oats of oats and steps that are about to get into your mouth.
They go on one side and they train their living room.
In the room, and doing the maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Spears.
He's with little clothes, dancing on his center of center, singing``Heat My Times Tom . ''
Now let me cook you.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path, and from the oven, they come to you Dorothy, the man of Alaska, the Antarctic and the lion of``The Wizard of Oz ,"grabbed from hands, jumping towards you.
Okay . Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the``The Media championships of The United States . ''
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist, waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a hypothesis superconductor.
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different hygiene habits.
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers, looking at them just once.
They memorized the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
They memorized entire poems in just minutes.
They compete to see who could memorize with faster the order of a deck of cards.
And I thought,``This is incredible . ''
These people have to be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best trained memories.
I said,``Ed, when did you realize you were a wise? ''
He said,``I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who's participating from this competition says they have normal memory.
\" We've trained us to perform these miraculous memory acts using ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques who used Cicero to memorize their speeches, and that medieval academics used to memorize entire books . ''
And my reaction was,``Wow . How did I haven't heard of this before?
We were standing outside of the living room, and Ed, who's a wonderful and brilliant English, although a little bit foreign, he said,``Josh, you're a American journalist.
You know Britney Spears? ''
And I said,``What? No, why?
\" Because I'd like to teach Britney Spears how to memorize the order in a live live deck, in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it . ''
And I said,``Well, I'm not Britney Spears, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something? ''
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the year, not just training my memory, but also researching, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called Ph.D. .
He's a classic, very likely with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a memory problem; it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how point our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Peter . He was based on the role of Dublin Hoffman in the movie``Rain Man . ''
We spent a afternoon in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorizing telephone books; it was flashing.
And when I go back, I read a number of treaties on written memory about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the antique and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having trained memory, disciplined and cultured was not such a weird thing as it can seem to us today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world possible, but they've also changed us.
They've been culturally changed, and I would say that we have changed too cognitively.
As we almost don't have to remember, sometimes it seems that we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained memory, disciplined and culture is this similar competition of memory.
It's not really that singular; there are competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated, I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from London College from London invited a group of memory champions, the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it that it has brains in some way, structural or intuitively different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than the rest?
They gave them a cognitive test battery, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting and meaningful difference between brains of memory champions and control subjects with whom compared them.
When they put them in a MRI machine, they scan their brains while they memorized numbers, faces and forms of snowflakes, and found that memory champions were lit in parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually used, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament of competitive marketing is driving as a armed career where every year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben Poline, three times.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 banks of haphazard chips that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just mastered.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 140,000 binary binary binary binary.
In half an hour . Yeah.
And while there's a lot of ways to remember things in these competition, absolutely all the techniques used at the end are reduced to one single concept that psychologists call``collaborative coding . ''
It was illustrated with a paradox called``the``Barbara . ''
That's his speed.
And then I ask you,``Remember, there's a``barrier.
And when I come back later, and I ask you,``Remember that word I told you a while ago? ''
\" Remember what it was? ''
The person who told her that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that their work is``balleried . ''
The same word, different ability to remember -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word,``ball"-- we know baker.
They use white hats.
They have flour in your hands.
They smell good when they come home to work.
We probably know some baker.
And when we first heard that word for the first time, we started putting up anticipation machines to catch them easily at some point.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is about 2,500 years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's called the memory of memory.
The story goes like this: there was a poet called The Seo that assisted a tank.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't take a DJ, it was hired to a poet.
He stood up, he raised his memory poem, and he went up, and as soon as it was, the room's room collapsed.
It's killing everyone.
But it didn't just kill them all, but it destroyed the bodies by providing them unrecognizable.
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
The bodies couldn't be buried.
A tragedy behind the other.
Early, stop outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, close your eyes and realized that with his mind's eyes, I could see where every invited was sitting.
I took the family members taking them back where their loved ones were loved between the rubble.
What Senior warned at that time is something that we all know more or less intuitively, and it's that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or word words by word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space.
If I asked them to give me the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Stone, it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if I ask you to say who I was sitting on the horse horse in their lobby, they would be able to visualize it.
The idea of memory's palace is to create this building with your eyes of your mind and populations with the things that you want to remember . The more crazy, slow, funny, awkward and stinky is the image, the more regular it will be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first deals of memory, in Latin.
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give you a talk and you want to make it memory, in the same way that you would have made Cicero if you had invited them to 1933 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine they're on the door of your house.
And to tell some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and unforgettable image to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely unfair competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and look at the monster of the crackers on Mister Ed.
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed Cook.
And then you would see Britney Spears to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they would go into the kitchen, and the fourth topic that you would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember.
So it's like the Roman speakers made their speeches, not words for word, which will confuse them, but typical by typical.
In fact, the term``typical"comes from the Greek``the"Greek, which means``place . ''
It's a dress of when people thought about the orchestra and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase``in first place, it would be like the first place in his memory palace.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got into that.
I went to some of these memory competition, and I had the idea of writing something extraordinary about this subculture of competitive memorized memorized.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a strong boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting there taking tests . I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets massage.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in these people's minds, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself into your place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem, or the names of an ancient school garden bought in a car market.
And I found that this was incredibly entertaining.
I would never have expected it to be.
It was entertaining, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's really about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, comics, provocative, international, absurd and functional, in the eye of mind.
I'm hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of ears and some security glasses covered with tape leaving only two holes, because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before, and I had the idea that I could enter, in some sort of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could serve a good deal for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition, something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's cute to be able to memorize speeches, and phone numbers, and shopping lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks . tricks that work.
Because they're based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be used to build memory sticks or market ships, and to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a big memory as if it would be an innate gift, but it's not the case.
Great memory is educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we focus deeply.
The palace of memory -- these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even shortcuts.
They work because they make them work.
They force a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of us don't get around.
But the reality is, there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do memorable.
And if there's something that I want to leave you today, that's what E.T, the tiles I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left myself, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our short existence to forgive us in the Blackberries or iPhones, not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks on our side . Are we so familiar that we don't even bother ourselves to process deep?
I learned firsthand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remembering.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture history.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we'll address just a complex place: New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from Yad Jersey, I was six and I lived there at home from my parents in a village called Line, and this was my child bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom who shared with my sister.
And, among my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that was going to be.
And there all happened the time looking at the TV . So every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone saw me . And every time I shower myself and I went back into a towel, everyone saw me.
And I was like this.
It was awkward, insecure and hated it.
He hated that journey, hated that balcony, hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
Ready.
Those feelings, those feelings that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, no division of areas, but about those visceral, emotional connections that we feel in the places we occupy.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency, Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean , 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what I'm going to do: you think of``power ,"`` stability"and``democracy . ''
And I know that you think about it for based on a building building two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a trigger that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection; we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, solid soldiers, in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who build, the organizers and the governments, they always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know they're going to work.
So we meet buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Library of Line that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome; it has this round thing, columns, red brick, which let me find out what Linus is trying to communicate with this building: the kids, the values of property, the history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library of today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, there was another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to meet, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the pendulum.
On one side is innovation; architects that are constantly pushing new technologies, new players, new solutions for the current life forms.
We push, we push and we push so much, that we get completely from people.
All of black, this depressed us . You think we feel very well, but we're dead inside because we don't have any other option.
We have to go on the other side and reconnect with those appreciated symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like computers, so we started experimenting again; we make the pendulum back and forth, over and over again . So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well , 30 years ago we went out of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called``brutal . ''
It's got to do with the concrete.
That can be guess.
Small windows, on climbing scale.
Something really hard.
So we approached 80, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know that like, and we update them.
We add a laugh, and we added cake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give up.
We take Capabil guns, and we turn them into skyscrapers, which can be medieval horses made of glass.
The shapes got stuck, they won in audacity and colorful.
The dwarf became columns.
The numbers grew up to the size of buildings.
A crazy thing.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs, we can create our own architectural fantasies.
Those fantasy could be to the Mediterranean, the French, or the Italian.
It's probably a neon of bread sticks.
This is what happens with symptom.
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we remember memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Tuscany.
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated, and we started making the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s, and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called designer.
We downloaded the historical symbols; we now count with new data-driven design techniques, and we find new compositions -- some ways that are star against other forms.
This is academic and recording, and it's super impossible; one is totally excluded.
Usually, the pendulum pendulum again in the opposite direction.
But then something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building is opened.
It's the Biokemara of Bilbao, Frank Gehry.
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Goldberg said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when criticism, academics and public in general, were completely according to a building.
The New York City paper filled this miraculous building.
The tourism in Bilbao increased in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those buildings: Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Sub-Saharan.
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms, wild and radical, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because media were galvanized around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of beginnings of the new millennium happened with other star architects.
He went to Italy and Benjamin, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all the architecture . The digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walking to the next village to see a building.
transportation is accelerating: you can take a ship, an airplane, can be tourists.
Technology accelerates . You can see in the newspapers, on the television, and at the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before knowing if the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been a good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The brutal was not a two-year-old movement, but 20 years.
We were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they detected them.
That's never going to happen . I think, because we're in the biggest revolution in architecture since the invention of the concrete, the steel or the elevator, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the pendulum to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes almost in the simultaneous, and it's actually spreading the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects, and you, the public.
Now we can do almost instant symbols, with emotional charge, of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that was lit.
This is a village in a village called Pianos on Fire Island in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was finished, it was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly the finished product, there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community . That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, became a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did from the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes the collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those British libraries.
If that building was built today, we first went online in search of``new libraries . ''
We would be bombarded with examples of experimentation, innovation, about what a library can be.
That's a ammunition.
ammunition that can lead to Line's mayor, to the people of Line, and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using brilliant words and complicated drawings, and you're not a skilled audience who doesn't accept something that you haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop by the architecture.
That means that the dominant pendulum of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems that face society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that building buildings will be very different to buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Kepler can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red bricks based on ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that a few robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are being added to the capabilities of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or yoga, or even one can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the New York City in New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the community around that cause, no longer a client.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little biomass pavilion, as muscular and beautiful as the animals that are going to look at.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build, what matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make buildings more ecological, more intelligent and more friendly.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides.
They find an architect, and they find it and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't just reflect our society, but they shape it to the smallest spaces: local libraries, homes where we form our children, and step from the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Stewart.
It just turned a year, and he started walking.
And he does it in that great way, typical of the children of a year, filling, as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and Chile, and it gives himself those big, moist kisses.
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all your friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and it made me think,``When stopped doing this?
How is it that we're suddenly not comfortable with our appearance?
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month , 10,000 people are looking at Google,```` Am I ugly? ''
This is Fahur, it's 13 years old and lives in Denver.
And as any teenager, you just want to be loved and fit.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's got a little scary, it's a little confused because even though his mom tells her all the time he's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Between what his mom says to him and what his friends, or school partners say, doesn't know who to believe.
So he makes a video of her, he published it in YouTube, and he asks others to please say,``Am I a nice or I'm ugly? ''
Well, so far, Gayla has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so disgusting, that it doesn't even deserve the question to think about them.
We talk about a healthy, normal and current teenager, which gets these answers in one of the stages of his most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's it taking you to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, chatting, giving me``I like, commenting, sharing, publishing, this is never finished.
Never before we've been so connected, so continuously, so young, so young.
As a mother told me,``it's like there's a party in your room every night.
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that come from hand with that are implanted.
This environment, to be always connected, is resisting our children to advanced based on the number of``I liked"that they have and the types of comments they get.
There is no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what is not.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what's digitally manipulated.
What is the most prominent thing in someone's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are you looking for inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are taken from the news news of the girls.
Zero models continue to dominate our islands.
The technical technique is now a routine.
And trends like, the manufacturing, the hole, the disconnect and the purpose.
For those of you who know it, the meaning means sexual.
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are compared to.
But kids aren't immune to this.
And the supermarkets of the sports of sports, and the momentum singers.
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we're sure we want our kids to grow healthy and are very good individuals.
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities, their studies and other ways start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look good enough.
These are not trivial activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as contributing to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class arguments, they avoid participating in classrooms, because they don't want to call attention for their physical appearance.
One out of five are not attending classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the exams of tests, if you don't believe you see enough enough enough, specifically if you don't believe you're thin enough, you get a smaller note to the average of your peers who don't worry about it.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it's independent about what they actually weigh these young people.
So, to make it clear, we're talking about how you see you, not how you're really.
The self-esteem on its body is debilitating the academic performance.
And it's also detrimental health.
The adolescents with a little bit of self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diets not healthy than you can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about what they make more risky decisions, like alcohol consumption and drugs, dramatic diets, aesthetic surgery, sexual relations to early ages and without protection and nature damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or not they have higher rates of feelings.
17 percent of women don't present a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that opportunity be?
To release this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking, by itself, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways . The first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that many well-intentioned programs, without realizing, worse the situation.
So, we need to make sure that the program that our children follow, not only will have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas . The first is family influence, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are key points for any willing to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
One education is fundamental, but facing this problem requires each of us who take the inputs in the issue and we're a better role model for women and girls in our own lives.
challenging the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to count with the contribution of our politicians in skin cuts or the size of their breasts, or to numb that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people because they are, not as you see it.
We can all begin by doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can praise people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you had a mirror?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our kids grow to value their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a pedestal.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they're never seen to be who they are, or achieving what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
To his wife?
To his sister?
Your daughter?
Your niece?
It could just be the woman who's two seats away, and what would it mean for her if it was liberated from that automatic voice inside, that he would kill him for not having long legs, more thin, small, little little bits?
What would it mean for her if we knew this, and would we say that it's going to say, red to their potential so?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is getting us all.
But let's show our kids the truth.
Let's show that the way you see it is just a part of your identity, and that truth is we love them for who they are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools of our schools.
We change each one of us, the way we speak and compared to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small tours of a year of age of today, become agents of safe change of themselves.
Let's do it.
On November 5 , 1990, a gentleman named Hamburge Mars entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi Council Kanzi, the leader of the Jewish Defense League.
They initially declared it innocent, but being prisoner for other minor charges, in company of others, started planning to about 12 icons in New York City, including tunnels, synagogues and the United Nations headquarters.
Luckily those plans were frustrated by a FBI informant.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 at the World Trade Center, couldn't avoid.
It would be harder to be convicted by his participation in that presentation.
Saramor Dr. is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an Egyptian engineer, with an American mother, elementary school teacher, between the two they did everything for giving me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims, come to know.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there's always a small fraction of people who are so deeply terrified to their conviction that they think they need to use every possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat with me and explained to me that in the last weekend, he and some friends had been going to train train in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the London River Zoo that, without knowing our group, was monitoring by the FBI.
When I got away, my father helped me hold the rifle in the shoulder and explained to me how to aim the target at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot, I gave the little orange light on the target, and for surprise of all, especially me, the whole goal in the flames.
My uncle came back to the other and in Arabic, he said,``Iran Hung . ''
From such a father, a child.
Everybody, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but only a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted to put a charges with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking of the North Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them``love ,"which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved on 20 times . That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do many friendships.
Every time I started feeling comfortable near someone, it was time to start and go to another city.
As I always was, the new face of the class was often victim.
I kept secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of class, silence and regulation, was enough ammunition.
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing games.
For these reasons, I didn't develop social skills, to say it softly, for growing up batteries, not prepared for the real world.
I was educated to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators, like their race or religion.
So how could I open your eyes?
One of the first experiences that had tested my thinking, was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a college program that I participated in the National Convention Convention, in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of youthful violence, as I had been a victim victim almost all my life, it was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different backgrounds.
One day, at the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the guys who we had made friendships, was Jewish.
I took several days going to the light this detail, and I realized that there was no symbolic between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend, and frankly, I was very proud to have been able to see the barrier that my entire life had made me believe that it was intentional.
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush Garden, a amusement park.
I met people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures, and that experience resulted fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had taught me that homosexuality was a sin and, by extension, all the gay sex was bad influences.
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most polite and fewer critics I had seen in life.
Having been abused by a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy to me to treat some nice people, exactly the way I would have wish to be treated.
And so, I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught myself as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is from being homosexual, but I know what it is to be judged by something else beyond my control.
Then he came the``Daily Show . ''
Every night, Jon Stewart became intellectually honest about my intolerance, and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my internal figure at a time when I was desperately trying to need it.
In occasions, inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian had a better influence in my life that my own father, extremists, was not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to conserve in my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless dogmas and said,``I'm tired of hate . ''
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all of that hate inside.
My real name is not Jackie Human.
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, someday, who I'm trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there's a better way, which even though I was told to this violent ideology, and I wasn't going to make me fantastic.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, by the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, against those meaningless acts, as a denial to my father's actions.
So with this simple, I'm showing here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' paths.
I'm not my father.
Thank you . Thank you all . Thank you . Thank you very much.
Right now there's a film that's projected in your mind.
It's an incredible metric film.
It's 3D, and it has southern sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell, taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as your childhood moments in front of your eyes.
And he has constantly a surprise voice in your conscious thinking flow.
The heart of the film is you who experience everything in direct.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film, you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least, I know I have a conscious awareness.
I have no certainty that you're conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason of living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal films?
Why aren't we just robots that we've got to produce outcomes without experiencing the internal movie?
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say that it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science, by nature, is objective.
The consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, I read that vision.
The psychology studied the behavior specifically, neuroscience studied the brain objectively, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
After , 20 years ago, everything started to change.
neuroscientists like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Pennsy said,``now is the moment for science to address consciousness.
And since then, there was a real explosion, an flourishing of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic . It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in recent years was the search for correlations, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kenya presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of correlations.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness, questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they correlate.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
It's no offense to neuroscientists.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't open the real central mystery of this matter: why all physical processes in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is a subjective internal movie there?
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emergent phenomenon like the champions, like the hurricanes, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
Typical surfaces are all kinds of emergent behaviors, how the symbols operate, how hurricanes work, how they reproduce, they adapt and metabolizing living organisms . They're all questions about objective work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and functions of the human brain as an emergent phenomenon: how we walk, how we talk, how we're playing chess; they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why is it that everything behavior is accompanied from an subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the emergence, the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a compassionate scientific material.
I want a scientific theory of the reflective that works . For a long time, I hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in physical terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we're sitting at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful, great explanations . We used to this; physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is kind of an anomaly, something that we need to integrate our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas . I think we need ideas that at the beginning seem crazy, before you can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
The crazy idea is that there is no such problem that's hard about consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain objective functions, brain behaviors, and so you study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely reductionist, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that I have, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promised.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental bricks: space, time and mass.
They exhibit fundamental laws that govern them, as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, they're considered fundamental, and there's the world built.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is long.
In the 19th century Maxwell discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental, space concepts, space, time, mass, Newton's laws, so it costs the basic laws of electromagnetism, and it costs the basic charge as a fundamental concept that those laws govern.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, load, then by question of logic, you have to move the list.
The most natural, the most natural thing to be able to witness the awareness itself as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not an object of science.
It opens the way to manage it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts: space, time, mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can stand in a paddle.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can stand in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws they are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called pressures:``bread"by all,``measure ,"by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs, mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob Knight, the elementary particles.
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that the photons are smart or thinking.
It's not that a photon can be full of distress when he thinks,``Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow up and smell the pink . ''
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of raw feeling, subjective, some primitive precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How do someone think something so crazy?
In part this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental.
If it's fundamental, like space, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems illogical, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that relate to thinking with physical process, is to link awareness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there's awareness.
Post of complex information, as in a human being, complex awareness.
Simple information processing, simple awareness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, Girl Tanzania, took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called the street, which measures the degree of information embedded in a system.
And it's supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible high degree of information integration, a high, very conscious degree.
In a mouse, there's a degree of information integration, which is very significant, very important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of designed.
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero.
In Tony's theory, there will still be a different level of zero.
I actually propose a fundamental law of consciousness -- high, high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that capitalism can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers often have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about the reality underlying.
As Stephen Hawking explained,``Where does the equations come from? ''
From the invisible vision, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically, describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found out of the physical world as a kind of additive.
It's right there in the center.
So this vision, I think, the invisible vision, has the potential to make our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences.
Some can be illogical.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I should be vegetarian.
If you're a sub, and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your visions, while what matters in ethical terms and moral consideration, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha movie?
Is it conscious?
According to the vision of the invisible information, she has a complicated, integrated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a fairly serious ethical problem about the ethic development of smart computers and the ethics to shut them off.
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of whole collective collective, the planet.
Canada has his own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED Talk, right now we have a collective collective awareness, an internal film for this whole TED group, different from the internal movies of each of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to take seriously.
So this invisible view is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental, that of the second, that it's universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally will discover it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an education profile.
I went to school, I struggled with my friends, I fought my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community approached my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said,``Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She actually hasn't got anything ."And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades . After school, I had a low profile on my mother's fight, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series``Fine The Simon Laden"and``Daniel's Creek . ''
Yes, I know . What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that I can consider as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of the teaching at a high school school in Melbourne, just after about 20 minutes on the 11 class of legal studies a guy raised his hand and said,``Hey, when do you give your speech? ''
And I said,``What speech? ''
Well, I had been talking to you about the law for a few good minutes.
And he said,``You know, your motivation speech.
When people in wheelchair, they talk about inspirational things in school? ''
\" Usually, in the act room . ''
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disabilities as an inspiration objects.
And we're not . And it's not the fault of the boy, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disabilities are not our teachers or our doctors or our marriages.
We're not real people . We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage looking like what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for them to inspire . Right? Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid to disappoint them.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that we have lied to disability.
Yes, they've sold us the lie that disability is bad, capital, M capital.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not bad, and it doesn't make it except.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even further this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this:``the only disability in life is a bad attitude.
Or this one:``its excuse is invasive ."Indeed.
Or this one:``before leaving, I'm smart!
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may have seen one, the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with fiber fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the original term deliberately, because they make a group of people for the benefit of other people.
So in this case, we identified disabled in the benefit of people without disability.
So the purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so that we can see them and think,``Well, it's very bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person . ''
But what if you are that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've had strangers, wanting me to express that they believe I'm brave or an inspiration source, and this happened before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I'm happy to get up in my morning and remember my own name . And this is to mean.
These images, those images identify people with disability of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
Let's take some things.
But the things that we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term``disabled people ,"deliberately because I'm being criticized by the social model of disability, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very upset with him.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of your ability as you as you do, and that's what happens with kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair to identify them in the way we do that, by sharing those images?
When people tell us,``You're a facility source ,"it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because we have sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't.
And I know what they're thinking.
I'm here hacking the inspiration, and you think,``God, Tesla, aren't you sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
Learning from other people with disability at all.
However, I don't learn that I'm more fortunate than them.
So I learned that it's a great idea to use a little bit of barbecue pictures to collect the things that are falling down, learning the ingenious trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our diagnosis, but against a world that is remarkable and it makes us complicated.
I really believe that that lie that we have sold about disability is the biggest injustice.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote:``the only disability in life is a bad attitude ,"the reason that it's lying is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a ladder of stairs has never done that it becomes a ramp.
Never . smile to a TV screen will not make the subtitles appear for deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and making a positive attitude to convert all those books to the braille.
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom, looking at``Fine The Some Space Leanano"is not considered any of anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who have disabilities that we're happy to get away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a young kid in a high school in Melbourne is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair.
disability doesn't make us remarkable, but to question what you believe to know about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and professional football, with empathy?
And what is the average speed of a single colonies?
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't melt.
When people think about augmented reality, think of``Britain Report, and in Tom Cruise, putting hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because reality is augmented to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step, is what I'm wearing: Google Glass glasses.
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google Glass is a device that allows them to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional sport in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe them.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and knowing what's running through the game field at 100 miles, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a 1,000 year-old man is chasing us, trying to tell us with all his self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not a nice thing.
I brought some videos to show you what's using Google Glass under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the NFL practices, because the idea of the emerging NFL NFL is a submarine rising on the surface . But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris Kula: Come on.
It's horrible to be cooking.
A moment . Let's zoom a little bit.
Are you ready?
Go!
Chris Kundwirth: As you can see, it's a proof of what it is to be hacked in the football field, from the perspective of the keyboard.
You'll notice that missing people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, cut from the University of Washington.
Company microphone: mice 54!!!!
Blue 8, Blue 8!! Come on!!!
Chris Kula: This is a little bit more to the feeling, but it has nothing to do with being in the NFL.
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, it's going to be their favorite players, and I've been asked to YouTube and Twitter,``You can see from the angle of a field capitalist.
What about a corridor?
We want to experience that . ''
Once we have that experience with Gallantic and Google Glass, how do we get full of us? How do we bring it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called City Rift, which is sure many already know.
The Rift Rift has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh!!
No, no, no! I don't want to keep playing! No!!
Oh, my God! Ah!!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a rollercoaster, and I'm afraid of his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video of Adrian Peter crossing the line, getting rid of a rebreather with the arm before you run and make a notation? What will be the experience of a fan.
When can I be annoyed by the court, launching the ball at the bottom of the network, or Redestice making a stick in Zimbabwe?
What will be your experience when you descended from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a Olympic skier?
Maybe the bake sales are increased for adults.
But this isn't really augmented.
It's just virtual reality, Red.
How do we reach the augmented reality, Chris?
We'll reach the augmented reality when the coaches, the nurses and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think,``How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win games? ''
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win . I give you money.
So, here's a brief journey about technology in the NFL.
In 1965, the Baltimore authors put a license to their field mask to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NFL put radios on the helmet of the field masks and then in the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2013, imagine that they're a player coming back to their group, and you see their next game shown in front of you, in a plastic view that you wear . You won't have to worry about forgetting a game.
I heard the strategy.
They just go out to the countryside and react.
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose themselves, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties, you get fired as coach.
And they don't want that.
But the augmented reality is not just a manual of strategies better.
Reality reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would it be done?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the sensors and the accelerometer, something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know to send it.
The bad will have information overload.
This will tell the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your reputations, and the analysis of data stopped being just for nerds.
It will be for sports . Who would have imagined it?
What would it be like in the field?
Imagine they're the field capitalist.
You get the ball and you go back.
You look at an open recipient . All of a sudden, a flashlight on the left side of your bombsight is that a defense behind you is going to attack you . Usually, you won't see it, but the system of A.I . system.
Go forward to the protection area.
Another flashlight tells you that there's an open receptor.
You launched the ball, but you get thrown down.
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land . However, the receptor sees in your view a patch of grass that's lit and can modify the career.
He's approaching, catch the ball, run and anatomy.
The public goes in and the fans have followed the game from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion in the game.
To make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
Reality augmented to be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: we want this to be the only use of augmented reality?
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus, like our usual entertainment?
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use the augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in another person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for sports ligament.
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology going to a teacher in the classroom trying to show a abuse how harmful their actions are from the perspective of the victim?
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how you're being pursued?
How much is it worth for a Carnegie Hadfield or a Neil Archielin Foundation trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quarterly and Kardashian notes?
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is approaching.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, they depend, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retire after 23 years of service at the University of California.
Most of those 23 years, I spent the southern extreme of Marine County, which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is a iconic structure, mostly known by his beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in 1937.
Joseph Streets, who was able to build the bridge, said that,``The bridge is pretty much proof of suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is not necessarily practice . ''
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you believe that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been done as such as, so the each one of them is freed from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that are going on underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a $four to five seconds, the body crashed against the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact broke the bones, some of which they would do vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't, normally they get stuck in the independent water and then drowned.
I don't think that those who contemplate this method of suicide realize the death of death that they're facing.
This is the wire.
Except about two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are before they take their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at their darker moment, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman spoke with a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the railing.
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
We fought to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who contemplating suicide, but the officers as well.
We've traveled a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new officers.
This is Jason Carrot.
I met him on the 22 of July last year when I got a call from a potential subject sitting in the heart near the center.
I responded, and when I came, I watched Jason talking to a official Golden Gate officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown to here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown until two times before New Jersey to try to suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason, he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.
By remembering Greek mythology, Richard created Pandora, and he sent it to Earth with a box, and he said,``Never, you never open that box . ''
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandora, and she opened the box.
And of course, they came up with pests, and all sorts of bad against the man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us,``What if you open the box and no hope? ''
He stopped a few instant, leaned on the right, and it was.
This smart and smart boy in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to Jason's parents that night, and I guess that when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be sounded very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had been asked.
The externalities of suicide affect a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out suicide?
What would you say?
You know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to speak, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
No dispute, blame, or tell the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the point of inflection you need.
If you think somebody is suicide, you're not afraid to confront them and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is,``Others in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life; have you had these thoughts? ''
Transparent people in front of it can save life and be the point of inflection for them.
Other signs to search: despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to improve; helplessness, believe that there's nothing you can do about it, recent social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read her.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote me this email just a couple of days ago, and he is with his permission and blessing that I read them.
\" Hi, Kevin . I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go through the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite numb, but more moments to realize really that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the game of the 49 with his father on January 19.
He never got there.
I called the police police and reported it as a disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and informed me that Mike's car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the 154 of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be especially too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without suffering a real mental illness?
It shouldn't be so easy to end her.
My prayers are with you.
The GMT, the poet Gold Gates is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, Rockett . ''
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and run the way that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I'm talking about hope and courage.
On March 11 , 2005, he responded to a radio call by a possible subject in the bridge of the bridge near the north tower.
He drove my motorcycle on the sidewalk and I looked at this man, Kevin Archie, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed immediately, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
For the time and the next time, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and hopelessness.
Kevin decided by his account that day back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, the happy.
\" This is a new beginning, a new life . ''
But I asked him,``What did it make you come back and give hope and life another opportunity? ''
And you know what he told me?
He said,``I heard.
You let me speak and just listen . ''
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter of Kevin's mother, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read them.
\" Dear Sir Greeks, Nothing erase the events of March 11, and you are one of the reasons why Kevin is following us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was smelling for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which has been properly medication.
And I adopted Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those heroic traits, but thank God, now we know.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We thank God for you.
Honestly, with you, Neil Archie . ''
And at the end she wrote,``Dad . When I visited the General General of San Francisco that night, you would figure out how the patient.
\" I'm going to do it . ''
Today, Kevin is a loving father of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and its depression with hope that their story inspired others.
The suicide is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got suicide.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, gave me the opportunity to meet it.
This is what the suicide does.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurting another person.
They just want your own pain to end.
Typically, this is only three ways: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls of suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason.
The other was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three occasions.
At the end, he looked at me, and he said,``Kevin, sorry, but I have to go . ''
And I jumped out.
Awful, absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we come to contact on that bridge are not suicide.
In addition, those few who have jumped out of the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second that they left side was realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge not only connects Maria with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us must be striving for doing.
The suicide can prevent.
There's help . There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you what you're not, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question makes you: How do you become that?
I should be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, I'm not alone alone.
When I became a model that I finally had achieved the dream that I had ever had from a child.
My outside finally agreed with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to refer later on, when I look at this picture, I think,``You know, Fine, you get it, you get it . ''
But last October, I discovered that, barely, I'm starting.
We all struggle our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of liberation, to get rid of the limitations of the skin color or by the beliefs of those around us.
They're people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, I ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was registered as``child"by birth because of the appearance of my genitals.
I remember that five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always carried this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me,``Why do you always take that t-shirt in your head? ''
I said,``Mom, it's my hair . I'm a girl.
So I knew how to get to myself.
The gender has always been considered an unchanging fact, but now we know that it's more complex and mysterious.
Because of my success, I never dare to share my story, not because I would think I'm going to be what I'm bad, but why the world deals to those of us who want to liberate.
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who accepted me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a Hindu goddess, goddess of the children.
And when I was eight, I was in a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries.
I was standing ahead of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me: This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I still saw a man, I met this woman called The Dallas.
It's the director of a fragile beauty competition.
That night she said,``Why don't you participate in the beauty of beauty?
He told me that if he participated, she would get away from the reservation spending and the costume, and that night, won in bathroom suit, won in a galaxy suit, and it was third grade between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from beauty of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of gunfire, especially when we traveled to remote provinces from the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends from that community.
In 2001, my mom, who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that they approved my green card request that I could go to the United States.
I was resistant.
I told my mother,``Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a beauty queen . ''
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said,``You know, if you move to the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of gender? ''
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two``and"to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was operating in Thailand at 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most prestigious, sophisticated and secure surgeries.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at driving license with the General name and the``F"of gender gender.
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means being able to drive or power to get a drink, but for me it was the license to live, to feel dignified.
Suddenly my fears saw themselves.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman in the Moon Earth.
A young woman in New York who vividly lived his truth, but he fired it, he put his life end.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November, we do a global surveillance for the Muslim Day of Labelous.
I'm in this stage thanks to a long history of people who fought and stood in front of the injustice.
These are Marshall D. Johnson and Sylvia Chernel.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, exposing me, so that one day there is no more surveillance in November.
My most profound truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you . KT Schulz: Great question.
Great George: Sure . You'll see, first, thank you with all my blessings.
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've attended young women, who I've done, and sometimes, when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept him . I took the phone, I called my mom and said,``Mommy, can you call this woman? ''
Sometimes working, others don't . It's just gender identity, that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all join a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that equation doesn't square, and that there should be a space that allowed people to identify, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transgender movement is beginning with gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you . Very nice . GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies, parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Bad started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007, and when their efforts were advertised in 2011, when his efforts in 2011, he was given very famous, a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at human history, the history of women is the history of injustice, inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when you birth a girl, his birth doesn't be celebrated.
It's not welcome, not for your father, not for her mother.
The neighborhood comes, it gives her continuous to mother and no one happy to the father.
And a mother is very overwhelmed by having a girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, it gets shocked, and with the hope of a child, when she joins her third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the mother suffer, but the daughter is born, when she grows, she suffers too.
At the age of five, when I should go to school, it stays at home and the school will admit their brothers.
Up until the age of 12, somehow, he has a good life.
It can be fun.
It can play with your friends on the street, and can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it served 13 years old, he's offered him to come out of his house without a male handshake.
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor call of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he spreads the code of that honor assumption, he could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this code code of honor, not only affects the life of a girl, also affects the lives of family members.
So this brother, sacrifice the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in name of honor supposed.
And there's a norm more of the patriarchal societies called emotion.
A good girl is supposed to be very quiet, very humble and very dirty.
It's the criteria.
The model of a good girl must be quiet.
It's supposed to be quiet, and it accepts your father's decisions and their mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if it doesn't want.
If you marry it with a man who doesn't like it, or if you marry it with an old man, it has to accept it, because it doesn't want to be a probability.
If you get very young, you have to accept it.
Otherwise, they call it dense.
And what happens at the end?
In words of a poet,``the house, they love it, and then it gives birth to more children and daughters . ''
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, I beat the same lesson for his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
Dear brothers and sisters, when I was born Malaway, and for the first time, believe me, I didn't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely honored.
And so much before I was born, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a freedom of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malaway from Manhattan, and she called my daughter so that she was.
But when I looked at, they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I brought a line from my name, and I wrote,``Bad . ''
And when she grew up, when I was four and a half years old, I admitted it in my school.
You might wonder, why should I mention a child's admission in a school?
Yeah, I have to mention it.
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies, is a great deal for the child's life.
In a school, it means recognition of its identity and its name.
Now, one addition to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where they can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks earlier, when I was able to see Canadian vision, and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the puzzles of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give to my sisters or her daughters, I thought he had to change it.
I used to appreciate intelligence and daughter of my daughter.
He encouraged to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encouraged to go with different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to insult them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malawi.
I've shared all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
He used education for empathy.
I taught my daughters, taught students, to forget the lesson of obesity.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the Newtonian call.
Dear brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called infection.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use veil and stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silenced, the young girls and the killed singers.
They suffered millions, but a few talked, and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and embrace when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10, Malawi got up and lifted up on the right to education.
He wrote a diary for the BBC blog, offered her for the New York Times documentary, and spoke on every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It spread as a love around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and October 9th , 2012, shot her into the head.
It was a fateful day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was debate between life and death, I whispered the ear to my wife,``I have to worry about what happened to my daughter, your daughter? ''
And instantly he said,``Please don't blame me.
It's the right cause.
You hold your life on the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired in you and joined you.
They were both on the right path and God protecting it . ''
These few words meant a lot to me, and I didn't wonder again.
When malleable was in the hospital and had severe pains and strong headaches, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that spread through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never complained.
I used to say,``I'm okay with my smile and with the entertainment in my face.
I'll get good . Please don't worry . ''
It was a comfort for us, and it's us.
Dear brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights and women, it's like any 16-year-old girl.
I cried when he didn't end his homework.
He fights with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me,``What's special in my tutor that has made so bold to Malawi so courageous, expressive and meme? ''
I tell you, I don't ask what I did.
Ask me what I didn't do.
I don't cut your wings, and that's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you.
I was operating of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the MIT group . From Google, where I've had a division to my charge -- the visualization of Google Ocean visualization, but all the work that I'm going to talk about here today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you take a brain operation.
Are you still as smart or not?
Not that, could you become intelligent?
After the neurosurgery, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the sticky death of the center that creates important hormones and symmetries.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what a lot to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, I would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them, to follow life.
More than one time I've saved myself.
But luckily, I have an experimental soul, so I decided that I would experience to try and get the optimal dose because there really doesn't be a clear map that I say in detail.
I started testing with different mixes, and I was surprised by seeing how little changes on the doses changed dramatically my guess, my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case: for a few months, I tried two typical chemicals and typical chemicals for a man in the 20s, and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts changed.
I was always furious, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person from all over the world, and -- of course, many times in the past I've known a number of guys like this, or maybe some stuck versions.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
In fact, I was trying, a little insecure, fixing a problem that had the front, and just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my doses.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through, since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do . When I adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to regain my intelligence after disease and operation, my creative thinking, my idea of ideas.
I tend to think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point: how do I get those mental images that I use to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to try new ideas and recreating situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
Philosophers like moisture, Descartes and Hobbes see things in similar form.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are those who question this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how mind works . To me is simple: for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and inventive thinking.
So, after several years, I managed to find the point right and I have lots of great mental images, really vivid, very sophisticated and structured.
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images quickly, from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use your imagination just to drive the world that has the front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can come to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to make this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
They were both using MRI technology, imaging for functional MRI, to represent the brain . Here you can see the brain scan done by Rio Gates and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you were imagining, looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by noticing the content of the central column on the left, and you see that the difference is almost zero.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost zero.
Now, let me share with you another experiment . This is from Jack Valley's lab at Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into recognizable visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains were scanned to create a large asset of brain reactions to video sequences.
Then, I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as a new scan was recorded.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scan, described it to show what seemed like the person was watching.
On the right you can see the computer measurements, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us contractors.
We're good about doing it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember that when you see a picture, and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same mapping.
This was conducted with the largest brain scanning systems today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we do it?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is open up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer for that.
Many are proposing new projections for images, even me, telling the recent result of the MRI, first we need to ask questions next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets, but at this point, more grain magnets only offer small improvements in resolution, not increased by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger magnets, we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements, like doing a spectrum.
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a great amount of effort in the MRI was to make really big magnets, right?
However, most of the recent advances of ingenious and brilliant solutions in coding and decoding, in the transistors and frequency receiver receptors in the MRI systems.
At his time, instead of a magnetic field, we use magnetic magnetic patterns attached to the FM radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the FM radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in a single scan.
Also, we can then divide our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using MRI, we should be able to measure not just the fluid of blood blood, but the hormones and symmetries that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity . This is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could spend above language and communicate directly through thinking?
What would we be capable of?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's cure and similar diseases.
We have a few more choices than open up this door.
Anyway, do you choose a year, happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take much more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have guns.
Her closet may be telling somebody for the first time that love or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have gone through in life.
Every gun is a difficult conversation, and although our topics can vary tremendously, the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's scary, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side World Cambridge, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of lethal military: I won't waste my armpits, quote the letters of Ann Di Franco as a litany.
And I'll be aware that because of the smell of my short pants, and for me to shave my head, I would ask myself a little kid,``Hey, are you boys or girl? ''
And it would appear in the table.
I would have my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a anger of anger.
The father would immediately smell the newspaper and the mother threw a cold eyes to his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would live inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
\" Are you a kid or a girl? ''
A family silence, but this time was prepared, and I was about to go into the female issues at the table . He had the dating of Betty Friedman.
The dates of Gloria Steinem.
Even a snippets of the Vagina Monologues that I would show.
So I'm going to breathe on and down my eyes and my backs a four-year-old girl with a pink dress, watching me what is not a challenge for a feminist owner, just a little girl with a question:``Are you boys or girl? ''
So, I'm going to breathe again, I put myself on close to her, and I said,``Hey, I know this is confusing.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more of the kind of girl in a comfortable pajamas . ''
And that little girl stares at me, paying attention, and he said,``My favorite pajamas is purple and has a fish.
Can you give me a tank, please? ''
And that was all . Just``Ah, OK, you're a girl.
What about the park that I asked for? ''
It was the most easy conversation of all ever ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the tank and I, both, were honest one with the other.
Just as many of us, I've lived in some closet in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a rainbow.
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color they are.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different than you or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you 100 reasons of why to get out of my closet, but this is the issue: The hard is not relative.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell you that explain to someone who has been declared in broken bank is harder to say it has been fooled?
Who can tell me that this story that I think is harder than telling your child than you're going to divorce you?
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We have to stop classification what's hard to us to the other person to make us feel better or worse relative to our weapons, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in weapons, and they may make sense security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you . Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and a senior shoe shoes.
It wasn't the military standing prepared to fight any four year-old child that would go into coffee.
I was frozen by the fear, recorded in a corner of my dark closet, looking at my gay cattle, and moving only a muscle is the most terrifying thing I ever made.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not disappoint them, and now the world turned around.
I was burning the pages of a guide that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't throw that grain, you will kill you.
One of my most memorable farm launches was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many among guests knew that I was gay, and when I do my honor ladies, in my black dress and heels, I walked around the tables and I finally got to one where friends' friends were, people who knew me years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women shouted,``I love Nathan Lane!
And the battle of the gay story had started.
\" Are you ever in the beaver? ''
\" Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San Francisco . ''
\" Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's fabulous . ''
\" Ah, you know my assistant Stanford?
It's very good, and he never talked about having girlfriend . ''
\" Ah, what's your favorite TV show?
Our favorite program? Will and Grace.
And you know who love? Jack.
Jack is our favorite . ''
And then a woman, puzzled, but instead of showing desperately his support, to get me to know that he was on my side, she finally said,``Well, sometimes my husband uses pink shirts . ''
And I had an opportunity at that time, like they have all the grain launchers.
Surely, it might have been easy to indicate where they felt mentioned.
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were dying.
And what else can you ask someone, but to work?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic you get.
That's how hard conversations continue without being my strong point.
Ask anybody to come out.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Boys' girl.
Now please look at this through gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves coming from any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
Use the armor . Be yourself.
That little girl in coffee had no armor, but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be genuine, others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct . Just tell you . You'll check your patches.
If you know that they're gay, you tell it.
If they say to your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly -- leave the complex.
You communicate your truth.
Never apologize for that.
And some of them can go out safe hurt, apologize for what they've done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some will feel disappointed, but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark dark, looking at a grain, you have to know that we've all been there before.
And they may feel very lonely, but they're not.
Thank you, Boulder . Enjoy the candle.
intelligence, what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has seen, a productive example has been the famous quote of Supermarket Course that``The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can swim . ''
When Survey Street wrote this, he did it as a critical to the pioneers of computing like Alan Turing.
And so a few years ago, I started a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're a alien race, you know nothing about the biology of the Earth or of the Earth's intelligence or the Earth's intelligence, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as Earthlings, we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth intelligence, they would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet that's instantly stopped.
And so I claim this is the same question as to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that pointed out, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology, for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be deeply adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the robotic movement planning, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end of making complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different topics and putting them together, I asked, for a few years, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues?
Is there just a equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is . What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to a E = E for the intelligence I've seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, F, that acts with the end of the future of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the choices open, with a force T, with the diversity of possible future future, yes, to an impending future, ethnic time.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay trapped.
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future action of action and maintaining open options.
And so, realizing this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How predictive is it?
It predicts the level of human intelligence?
Does artificial intelligence predict?
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: recent research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or``entropy ,"during their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection contractor is consistent between entropy and insulin intelligence a deeper relationship?
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of long-term entropy, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we developed a software engine called Encrupendine, designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you find inside.
Amazingly, entropy could pass multiple animal intelligence tests, playing human games, and even making money trading actions, all of that without being forced to do that.
Here are some examples of European in action.
Just like a human standing in foot, here we see Etched balance automatically a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it to Antarctica a goal.
He simply decided to balance the pole.
This ability of balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling out of opposite ends of a rope at the same time to release food, here we see that entropy can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
Etchio is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
So for example, here we see successfully playing a steam game against itself, illustrate its potential for the game.
Here we see Architecture to bring new connections into a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keep successful the network well connected.
This same network network capacity also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see Encolbort organizing the routes of a ship of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand globally its grasp from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, Encolbort is widely applicable to problems in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see Detroit spontaneously discover and execute a strategy of a complexity, it's a series of a simulated series of actions of actions, successfully increasing assets under its exponentially managing management.
This ability of risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex Keroian: What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future action future.
Now, here's a deep irony.
Let's go back at the beginning of the term of the robot, the work``Route"-- there was always the concept that if we developed smart machines, there would be cyber rebellion.
Machines would be lifted against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber rebellion to reverse.
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then market and trying to learn the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking control of all possible futures is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, which general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of objective.
And I'm often asked,``How do you look for goals to stop this kind of frame? ''
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future action of action and avoiding constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call``home . ''
Although, in the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting around other stars, which means that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the intense light intensity of stars when planets go through them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler show the size of planets in addition to the distance that there are among them and their mother star.
In a set, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocks like the planet planets in our solar system, and also how much light they get from their sun.
At his time, this gives clues on whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this power of potentially habitable worlds, our own planet is losing under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest record.
glaciers and sea ice that have been with us from making millennia now are disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused to global scale have overcome our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a scientist of climate, no astronomer.
But I study the ability of the planet influenced by stars, with hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the immune sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for Earth-like planets, the more enjoying our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better: those of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and loving, and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially habitable world shown this by a mission like Kepler.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both of Mars.
Our Rovers are tracking their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit it, like the mobile mission, take samples of the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their ability.
The private companies now offer not just spatial flight, but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all these Mars images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the software and pressure ideas, compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the desert areas of our planet that still remains to colonize, really scary places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places of the Earth, the air is fresh and full of oxygen stuck by our rainforests to thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement for Mars colonization and other planets dragging with a big and sad shadow: the implications and belief of some that Mars will expect there to save us from this unique infrastructure of the only planet that we know is truly habitable, the Earth.
And so I like the interplanetary exploration, I'm deeply disagreement with this idea.
There are many good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of truth will have place later on the wild boats . Thank you.
But the goals for the planetary exploration and the Earth preservation is not contradiction.
No, they're actually faces of the same coin: the goal of understanding, preserving and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world as alien machines.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in hostile areas and parts of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment: the Fermi paradox.
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked: realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence from the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that drive this development.
It's arrogant to think that just planetary colonization will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and the interplanetary exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to protect the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the skill on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had left them.
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all fine.
I thought I'd call a stroke, at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a stroke could take a long time to get, and I was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend from Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and I was predicting my passport and my suitcase.
It would be expensive, but surely I'm not more expensive than a middle of the night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, it was fine.
I'm a professor and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
It releases cortisol to increase the heart rate, modulate levels of adrenaline, and he bursts the thought.
And when I got to the manufacturing disaster in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in their place, that prevent that bad things happen.
Or at least, if you happen bad things, that they minimize the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe.
So I got to think about that, but until a month after my thoughts, my thoughts weren't wiped out.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Katerian, Nobel Prize winner, and a little embarrassed was talking about that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called prospective retrospective.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about this a few years before, known as the premise.
You all know what the gun is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the premise, as Danny explained, you look forward and trying to figure out all the things that might go wrong, next, try to figure out what can do to prevent that things happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a chess.
Some of them are evident, others are not so obvious.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, I'll give a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis, based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over the course of thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the good is, where the fish are, where the tribes of friends and enemies live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that's stored in London's taxi.
It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the smell of the squirrels, and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing cars, glasses of reading and passports.
So in the house, they make a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For its passport, a particular box.
For their reading glasses, a particular month.
If you give a place and they're speculation with it, your things will always be there when you look for them.
What about travel?
Take a picture of your credit cards, license driver, passport, poison by email to themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or the steal, this can ease the substitution.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.
The cortisol is toxic and interpreted the thought.
So part of the raw practice is to recognize that under stress, we won't be in the best moment, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved self, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is called a record for all of medical decisions, and in fact for decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of facts.
So we assume that they go to the doctor and the doctor says,``I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit high . ''
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, attack to the heart, stroke brain.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says,``I'd like to prescribe a drug that will help you reduce the cholesterol, a state.
And maybe you've heard about the statistics, and you know that it's one of the most prescribed drugs in the world today . It's probably likely that you know people who take them.
And so you think,``Yes, I'm going to make the state!! ''
But there's a question that is supposed to be done then, a statistic that should be asked for which most physicians don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the notation, the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the Kennedy?
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or avoid surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And should you think about what kind of expresses that is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor would not give me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a fault of the doctor, and if it's someone's fault, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanisms.
But the estimates of HIV/AIDS that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely recipe, which you think is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers Jeremy Geographic and Pamela Arthur, confirmed independently by Boomer.
I myself explore numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, stroke stroke or another adverse event.
Now you might think,``Well, one probability in 300 of down my cholesterol.
Why not, doctor? Say the recipe anyway . ''
But then you have to ask for a more statistic statistic, and it's,``Tell me about the side effects ."Right?
For this particular drug, side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include terrible things: debilitating pain, muscle pain, interesting pain, but now you think,``Five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking medicine . ''
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think of clarity.
So think of how you would look at this over time, so they don't have to make the reasoning chain in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has helped, five percent of the 300 have secondary effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that helps you medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the state.
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires it, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to having access to this kind of information to start conversation about whether you want to take risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air because of the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat it quite typical.
For the surgery that's more done in the older men of 50, smallpox of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is 49.
So , 49 surgeries for a person who has helped.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or erectile dysfunction, urinary failure, real Greek, fecal failure.
And if you're lucky, and it's one of the 50 percent the effects will only last a year or two.
So the idea of the premise is to think about before the questions that you can plan to drive the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Do you have a choice many times, do you want a shorter life free, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases cortisol under stress, and one of the things that happens at the time is that they turn off a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predator, you don't need the digestive system, or liberty or immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react fast . They could become the lunch of lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is rational logic thinking, like Danny Katera and their colleagues have shown.
So we have to train us to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all flawed.
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those failures, to put the systems in the place that will help you minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things happen in the first place.
Because I lived at the night of snow in Montreal, when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key door in the entry, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards I haven't ordered, and lots of email messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter:``P"is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing softly.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a``P"on the score, you need to play more softly.
Two' feet, even more gentle.
Four' feet, extremely soft.
This is my drawing of a tree tree, and you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of feet can, you'll never get to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of silence: a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the NSA, besides a little story.
The French sign language came over the 1800s, and with the time time, it's mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we know as PSA.
So, it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born deaf . And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a deaf person who lives in a world of sounds, it's as if I lived in an foreign country, following your rules, custom, behaviors and norms without questioning them.
So how do you understand sound?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my loudspeakers and amplify sound.
I learned and copy that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people respond.
So I've learned, for example.
\" Don't stroke the door!! ''
\" Don't do much noise when you eat the bag of potato chips! ''
\" Don't require, and when you're eating, I make sure you're not going to take the covers on the dish . ''
All this is called``sound label . ''
Maybe I think of the label of sound more than the average person does.
I'm super visionary of sound.
And I'm always waiting with the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
TED, for deciding.
The IPCC, for continuing.
TBP, for announcing.
You can see that the architecture doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle and blobs.
In the wild culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign for``parallel"in Israel.
A typical representation has five lines.
However, to me, to do this with my thumb, it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painter.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different galleries, and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At the time, sound was the trend, and that called me attention.
There was no visual art, everything was auditory.
Now the sound has entered my land of art.
Is it going to distance me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like that.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know so well that it's not just experienced through ears.
I can feel it in a tactile way, or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and integrate it in my artistic practice.
And everything they had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and learn it.
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control: social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was oblivious, it was something of a conscious person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to replace myself and my artistic work, or I could empower myself.
I chose to empower me.
There's a massive culture around language language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from the same and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, work and institutions, work with many different interpretations of Israel.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be heard.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I asked you to borrow their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value, something like taking a loan with a very high rate of interest.
If I didn't continue to continue this practice, I feel that it could be deployed in oblivion and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, I profound in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and the PSA.
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same can be told by a concept in PSA.
The two are very space and highly stimulated, which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals like sound.
I'd like to share a metaphor of the piano, so they understand better how the PSA works.
So, imagine a piano.
The PSA is divided in many different thermal parameters.
If you assign a different parameters for each finger while you touch the piano, like facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so on, as you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if it would put only one key at the same time.
However, the NSA is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers simultaneously to express a clear concept or an idea in PSA.
If only one line would change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone, timbre and volume.
In PSA, using these different Brazilian parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal``the sign of that.
This is the sign,``Look at that . ''
I'm watching you.
It's easy to look at me.
Oh, I was hacked.
Ooh.
What are you looking at?
Ah, stop!
So I got to think, and if I see the PSA through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of``day, the sun goes out and it goes.
This is``all day.
If you repeat it and reduce speed, visually it looks like a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell you about``all night.
\" All night . ''
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about about three different types of nights:``night ,"`` at night ,"`` all night.
I feel that the third one has more music than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in PSA and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one condition . It's a hand, two steps . It's two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So, the first example is``a long time ago.
Then,``past"--```` Such"and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic, dramatic idea at once,``Once . ''
\" Time Time"is a musical term with a specific pace of four times per purchase.
However, when I see the word``common time ,"I think automatically at the same time.
See Memo: hand hand, E: left hand.
We have the spinner through the head and the chest.
[ Face: Fed .) [Unclear] ] [In the chest: E, E, I'm going to show you a form of your hand called``Florida Florida . ''
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands.
Now we're going to do it both in the head like chest, something like``common time ,"or``at the same time.
Yeah, very good.
That means``love"in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and sign languages around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this . Please do it again.
And now this is.
It means coordination in the Atlantic.
Now, third . Please take me back.
And again.
It's``illumination"in the PSA.
We're going to do the three together.
\" Love"and``influence . ''
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar . They all happen in the head and the chest, but they transmit very different meanings.
It's amazing to see how Islam is alive and thriving, just like music.
Today, today, we live in a very American world.
And only because the NSA has no sounds, automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what social value is defined and allow the ethanol to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn NSA, not to learn to learn music.
The NSA is a rich treasure, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even love us.
Thank you.
Dan Katershot: Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said to me,``You can teach it everything, but then you have to clean it out . ''
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults are lied to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also teach and that they're not very good to clean each other.
Time happened, now I'm an adult and teach citizen and invention in Hong Kong School.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk around the beach with lots of garbage piles.
So, as good citizens, we clean the beaches, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it's, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a wonderful thing.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those bits of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we classify them and collected this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity, and it's very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those huge boats.
So along with my students, with six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny place in Hong Kong in a workshop.
So we started building this mission of work with a height that children very low can be involved.
And I'll tell you, the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fragmentation.
That's what we do.
I leave the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine them into something we expect it to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic bits, we're just collecting information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this plastic -- the kids get excited with robots.
Then we created quickly what we call``a prototype . ''
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we transform lamps and web cameras in accessories and we assemble it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer's computer process this image and measure the size of each particle, to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We documented this invention step on a website for inventors called``Muslim ,"with hope that someone's best best.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and boom, they're trying to get it immediately.
[ I can investigate my local problem] -- but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, you take the Internet, and they were shot with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using hands, in London, the largest mangroves in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that you drink, it's the water in which you bathe, the water where you fish, the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and oil are also brown color, and when everything gets mixed, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called a sexual program, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a spectrum that can roll through all kinds of substances that produce different spectrum, which can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote way to other children.
[ I can investigate a problem at a distance] -- I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to tackle a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that there were several giant waves, called tsunami, and those tsunamis destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power center.
And today, according to the reports, a average 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has pollution traces by 2013.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure Fukushima radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it's safe, it's blue.
Well, it's a little bit more complicated than that.
I've come back to Fukushima every year from the crash and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring children.
Of course we didn't take them, parents didn't allow them.
But every night we report to control center -- here you see the use of different masks.
It might seem like they didn't take the job seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with privacy all their lives.
Together with them, we discussed the data that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the English, etc.
And to do this, we created a three-dimensional topographic map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pigments to represent data in real time of productivity, and we sprinkle water to simulate the rain.
With this, we were able to notice that the radioactive powder was filtered from the top of the mountain to the bank system and had destroyed in the ocean.
It was an approximate estimate.
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear central to date.
We came up to a mile of nuclear nuclear, and with the help of fishermen from the area, we were collecting sediments of the sea milk with a sediment tracking as we invent and build.
Here we see a progression: we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong, and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optics, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where kids' dreams can come true with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
Students: acceleration! acceleration!
Theaster Hawaii: We asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help the mobility of the advanced age, transforming its standard wheelchair chairs in new electrical vehicles?
The plastic, oil and radioactivity are terrible legacy, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect kids from the awful truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So, scientists, creators, designers, we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin domes, two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one silk silk.
One of them is synthetic, the other organic.
One is about the environment, the other creates it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble marble, he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The paintbrush was the only tool of Michelangelo.
But the living ones are not climbing.
They grow.
And in the smaller units of life, the cells, we took all the information required for each cell to work and replicate.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by the origins of manufacturing and production.
The assembly lines have been telling a world made of parts, addressing the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects as a distinctive part of design with different functions.
But you don't find a male material assembly in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with dominated pores.
The skin skins are more thick with small pores.
One act primarily like filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assembly.
It's a system that will gradually vary its functionality by variation of plasticity.
Here's a divided screen that represents my worldview from the divided world, the double personality of every designer and architect by working currently between the crime and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions in the world, getting away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask yourself, why now?
Why wasn't this possible 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they connect four disciplines that offered designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools across scales, large-scale, like this robotic arm with a 24-hour scope with a reach of 24 meters of diameter with a cochlear basis that some day not very distant to print entire buildings, and graphs to genetically engineered microorganisms made up in the dark.
Here we have reinvented the cellulose, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is of unique size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a skirt . This was for a fashion mold in Paris with Iraq Van Van . It's like a second skin made of a single piece, which is run in the outlines, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, we print this layer and failed 3D 30 degrees between cells . I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microns.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CD scanner.
That designers have access to this high resolution analytical and synthetic instruments, allow to design products that are adapted not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, comfortable, and also absorbs sound.
Professor Carter, my collaborator, we went back to nature to inspire us, and by designing this irregular surface pattern, it becomes Selanchian.
We print this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in stiffness, obesity and color, correspond to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies its functionality does not by addition to another material or another assembly, but constantly monitoring and deliberately property.
But is it ideal nature?
Aren't there parts in nature?
I didn't give up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Hebrew Bible, and one of them came up and define a lot of what I care about.
As she says,``in the third day of creation, God sent the Earth to grow a fruit tree.
For that first chemical tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and fruit.
The whole tree was a fruit.
Instead, the land made trees grow trees, cortex, chickens and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself,``What would design if objects were made by a single piece?
Could we go back to a better state of creation? ''
So we look for the biblical material, the kind of material tree material, and we found it.
The most abundant biopolymers on the planet is called suicide, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate multinational structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal darkness . We asked a bunch of shrimp husks, we fold them, and we produced mosquito cake.
Looking at chemical concentrations, we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures, it was built a system with multiple extract nozzles controlled dramatically.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one single material three, and it's 100 percent recyclable.
When the pieces are ready, they leave them dry to find a natural shape in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with plastic?
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain synthetic microorganisms that appear for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we pushed the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of sight to mesh, and if you zoom even more, to windows.
A chemical tree loaded by fruit.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, put in the sea, feed marine life; and put on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The adjustment for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to maintain life for planetary travel.
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the periodic table, we made our own table of elements: new forms of life created computational, manufactured and growing in biological form.
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid liquid, just instead of engaging precious metals, new biological functionality inside very small channels.
This field is called microphone.
We print our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, two microorganisms combined.
The first is collaboration.
It lives in our oceans and the freshwater tanks.
And the second, E. coli, the bacteria that inhabit in the human intestine.
One convert the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract, to help them flow these bacteria and they alter their function.
So we started growing those channels in the human body, by looking at the properties of the material according to desired functionality.
If we wanted more photosynthesis, we wanted more transparent channels.
This remarkable digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another , 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our thin intestine.
And here it is, as TED in TED, our first portable photograph, brilliant liquid channels in the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shelley said,``we are past creatures, only half is made . ''
What if design would provide the other half?
What if we could create structures that increase life?
What if we could create personal microbes that scan our skin, repair the damaged tissue and held our bodies?
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer printed material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do it like this.
It grows . It's a profit with sophistication.
This worm of the worm, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is motivated.
The nonprofit manufacturing is about this level of sophistication.
It makes it through combination, not two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations.
An act as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, bringing those fibers together.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first comes up in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then it starts to hurt a compression of compression.
The tension and the compression, the two forces of life, are manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm, to the grass.
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complexity of the silk worm of silk worm.
However, by putting the silk worm on a flat patch, not within a box, we realized that it would hurt a flat chicken and still dramatically removed.
So we started designing different environments, different scaffolding, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the cocoon, is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often get the silk worms to death inside their cocoons, their silk silk, and it's used in the textile industry.
We saw that we're designing these templates, we can shape the raw silk without a single back.
It would be synthesized, and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to architectural scale.
We had a folded robot making silk silk, and we put us in our site.
We knew that silk worms to more dark and cold areas, so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or openings, to block the rays of light and heat, destroying silk worms on structure.
We were prepared to get the caterpillars.
We asked 6,000 worms of silk to a online silk farm.
And after you feed them four weeks, they were ready to hurt with us.
We placed them carefully in the lower edge of the scaffolding, and as they were grasses, they were conditioned, they mate, they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much shorter.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By adding biological silk on the silk silk basically, they give all this pavilion.
And in a little more than two or three weeks , 2,000 worms of silk six thousand miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The moth, after the scene, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra pavilions in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk thread by a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to provide the products and buildings around us, to form a two material ecology, designers must bring these two visions together in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at first.
Here's a new age of design, a new era of creation, which leads us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired in design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we do burden of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much . Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them,``What do you want to be? ''
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time?
They can show you with fingers.
Three . Five . Three . Five . Five . Five.
Now raise your hand if the question,``What do you want to be? ''
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question,``What do you want to be? ''
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had too much.
In school, I liked English, the killing and art and developed websites, and also, I played the guitar in a bank band called Texas frustrated.
You may have heard about us.
And in general I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time this feeling of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it's coming up.
And I have to leave it.
But then I'm interested in something else, something completely different, and I dive into it, and I'll let myself absorb and feel``Yes! I found my way ,"and then again this point where I start to get bored.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to focus on that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and I'll be able to get bored.
Another reason I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there would be something wrong with this, and something wrong about me for not to be defined by anything.
I was worried to have fear of engagement, or to be dispersed, or whether I'm going to activate or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked myself to do.
Ask yourself, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they learned it: they learned from culture.
We're asking first,``What do you want to be?
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that no one cares what you answer at that age.
It's considered an naive question to cause soft answers in children like,``being an astronaut ,"or``to be a dancer ,"or``I want to be pirate.
They insert the statement of HAL here.
So this question is over and over as we grow up in different ways, by the way, to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point,``what do you want to be?
It's about being the cute exercise of before we take sleep.
Why?
If this question inspired kids to dream about what they might be, not inspired to dream about everything they could be.
In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though you adults well-intentioned, you might go,``Oh, what nice, but you can't be craftsmen of violins and psychologists.
You have to choose . ''
This is Dr. Bob Chile, and he's an artist of rape and psychological.
And this Amy Nigeria, editor editor turned into illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher and creative director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of concentrated life is very idealized in our culture.
It's this idea of fate, or the real vocation, the idea that each of us has something to spend for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're someone who isn't connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues to wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for somebody like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a target.
And I feel there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a juxtaposition.
A reassuring is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a banana for this.
It could help if it's divided in three parts: multiple, potential and damage.
You can also use other terms that you tell the same idea, as a scholar, state.
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Serevis refers to us as``selections.
Use any term you like or invent one of them.
It seems to me as a species to adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see juxtaposition as a limitation or an app that you should come to.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being like this.
There are three political superpowers here.
One: ideas of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in intersection.
Shesher Hamburge and Rachel Bing expressed their interests shared in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, by founding Amy.
Ph.D. is a company that creates heroic jewelry geographically.
Now, Mr. and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his bike mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens in intersections.
That's where the new ideas.
And multiply, with all their backgrounds, can access a lot of these points of intersection.
The second superpower superpower is fast learning.
When we're interested in something, we go to that.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be beginners, for having been many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort zones.
A lot of skills are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we pursue, so we rarely start from scratch.
Now, Danny Dan is a full-time journey and an independent writer.
As a pianist child perfection an incredible ability to develop the muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest machine known.
Before becoming writer, Ray was financial planners.
He had to learn the most end of sales when he started their practices, and this ability helps him write compelling launches for publishers.
It's rarely a waste of time going on to what you're drawn to, even if I finally abandon it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have foreseen.
The third political superpower is adaptability . I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
It's sometimes director of videos, other, web designer designer, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently, James Bond.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles, depending on the needs of their customers.
The Fab Company Company defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and unpredictable that it's individuals and organizations that can pivot to satisfy the needs of the market, which really thrive.
synthesis of ideas, rapid learning and adaptability: three abilities where political beings are very adept, and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to encourage the potential to be themselves.
We have complex problems, multidimensional problems right now, and we need not conventional thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
They came out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be pediatric neurosurgeons.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams are set up from a specialist and a balance balance.
The specialist can dive deep and put ideas in practice, and computation offers an breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that make the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the crowds in large part are encouraged to just be more like their specialized partners.
I once said this, if there's one thing you get from this talk, I hope it's this: Do you think about the inner wiring, whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then especially for all media.
That's where you will give the best thing.
But for the practitioners in the room, including those who just realized to be one of them in the last 12 minutes, I say,``reconcile with their many passions.
They follow their curiosity for those rabbits.
They explore intersections.
embracing our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, political, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In 1991, a woman called Turkey was brought to a psychiatric in New York.
It didn't even remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was Heart.
You didn't know how to help Uruguay, but he was blown by it until, unfortunately, he died in 1906.
After his death, Heith did a autopsy and found strange, color plates in the House of Hercules, a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If I had been alive today, we couldn't give her more aid than Hasbro gave him about 14 years ago.
Agnes was Dr. Brothers Alzheimer.
And Courty Department, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer disease.
Since 1991, medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infection, a lot of treatments for cancer, transparent for HIV, stations for hospitals and much more.
But a little bit of progress has been progress in Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's over a decade ago.
So I think of this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affecting 40 million worldwide.
But in 2050, it will affect 150 million, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live until the 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's going to be almost one in two.
In other words, there's a chance that they're going to spend their golden years with Alzheimer's or helping care for a friend or being loved with Alzheimer's.
In America alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent in Alzheimers disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease, and their costs will give rise to five times in 2050 as you get older the generation of the boom.
You may surprise them, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't prevent, cure or even heating their development.
We understand less about Alzheimer than other diseases, because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than in Alzheimer's research, despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes an annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause: the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what times people know, but everybody should be: Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 14 years, everyone, even, scientists, confuse Alzheimer's aging aging.
We think that it will become sensitive in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy aging brain compared to the Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to understanding a severe loss of memory and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer found plates and sex books in the brain of Achilles a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like a origami.
There are places on paper that are sticky.
And when it folds well, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules attach each other, forming groups that can form great plates and phones.
That's what we see in the patient's brain with Alzheimer's brain.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this dysfunction works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what's going to block is complex, how to defuse a bomb.
A cable could do anything.
Cut others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocks it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and expecting the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, geneticist, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process, and now it's testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when we test these drugs in worms.
These are the healthy worms, and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms, on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick into each other in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that they heal and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 14 years of waiting, there's real hope of what can be done in the next 10 or 20 years.
But in order to grow that hope, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to realize that Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and if we try it, we can beat it.
In other diseases, patients and their families have started more research and exercise pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislators.
That was essential to advance HIV treatment in the late '80s.
We see that same unit to convince cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims, caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too upset to go out and advocate for change.
So, it's really dependent on you.
Alzheimer's not, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Guildo, who can't create the change they need for themselves.
They help talking for them, and they help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To love somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when I tested it myself at night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers get together to make 36 questions more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions.
Number 12: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would it be??
Number 28: When was the last time you cried to another person?
And just?
As it moves forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30 :...I really like -- I like -- Tell your partner what you get from him or she's -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've just met.
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention, the gossip that two of the participants had been married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So, I was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also intrigued.
And when I had the occasion of testing this study, someone I knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to love.
However, we fell in love, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the Blue Love column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already August, so I guess some of you probably ask: Do you follow together?
And the reason I think you're questioning this is because I have already asked this question over and over in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book over the last few years, so I had been forced to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagining that my New York Times article would probably reach a few thousand views.
And that runs a good deal of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as it did, I had no idea.
The article was published online a Friday afternoon, and already Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called the South Show and the World Marine Network.
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage the confidence by writing with sincerity about their own love experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news, and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or write, what they did every day for weeks, always, they asked the same question: Don't they follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase,``Do you still follow together? ''
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewing in radio and asked him.
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage,``Hey Mandela, where is your boyfriend? ''
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the resource of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be alive alive.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for Valentine Galapagos, including the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said no to every request that we both did a public exhibition together.
I've done television interviews, and the photos of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid to become the iconic icons of the process of love, a range for which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked, whether it was, if it was able to produce a hard love, not just a adventure, but real love, perfect love.
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, especially, that people ask the wrong question.
How do you know if we're going to keep together or not, and also tell it?
If the answer was no, would it do the experience of doing these 36 less interesting questions?
Dr. Arthur Aron wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997, and there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I sought to foster interpersonal access between college students, using what Aaron called super-disappearance personal openness, progressive and reciprocal.
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing it . A lot of street studies also used the Project Prime Project of Acumen as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it among the members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of opposite political ideologies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, who combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was quoted in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me with shyness: I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed disconnected for it.
And I: Do you mean that you fall in love with the person who did it?
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I: Did you become better friends?
Do you feel like they did better after testing the study?
The point.
So, it worked ,"I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you is looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled with the studio for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, which I assumed practically all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went into science.
I research everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could somehow be able to live the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I was just investigating for the book I wrote, but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought that if I was armed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love . I'm more relaxed.
I have more confidence to demand what I'm looking for.
But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you can get to me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee, not just to be loved today and being loved tomorrow, but to continue to be loved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to love.
There may be a form to somehow mitigate some of the implicit risk, and this is a very slow story, because we love makes us feel wonderfully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that asks: Don't you follow together?
And his content with a response of Yes or not.
So more than a question, I would propose we ask harder questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't?
How do we stay in love when things are complicated, and how do you know when cutting and distance?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably delivers a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your partner doubt?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship story, it's this one -- a year ago, a known and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we fall in love, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But we love not the same thing to remain love.
Now, love is the easy part.
So at the end of my article, I wrote,``Love didn't happen.
We stay in love because we took the choice to be.
And I sent a little bit when I read it now, not because it's true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that's supposed to do that choice.
I don't consider how many times we're going to have both to make that decision, and how much times you have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he always chose to choose me or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, I would have chosen to love someone so generous, nice and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't really believe.
And what I'm looking for, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending in the title of my article, which is, by purpose, the only part of the article I didn't really write.
But what I have instead is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and hope that he also love me, and it's terrifying, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian in full mountains, and in a way, I came up with a symbol of the forest.
The city of New York a long time ago, which really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange humanities or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat spaghetti.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's got grace because here I am , 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a time I was in Hawaii -- I like to go out of diving and make surfing and all those weird things -- and I was making a wire for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I put all the pages and I made a kind of cracked cells to the Agnes Martin style, covered by resin and a bee stuck.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and she's allergic to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking he could hide it.
Instead, the opposite thing happened: somehow it seemed like it grew up, as if you look at the text with a magnifying magnifying.
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, weird bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate them and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow strokes, drawing the same thing that's around a cliff in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.
First of all, botanical -- that you can make an idea.
Then I did some strange insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the resin layers.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to pizza.
It was great, man.
At some point, I'm interested in the human form, the natural size sculptures, with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I died.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on glass layers, similar to drawing in a window, then in another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the resin.
So I did this for years, and my work culture with something very big, which I call``Twitter . ''
For the``Taliban"inspired me in a big measure in``The Garden of Species"by Hieronymus Bosch, which is a painting in the Museum of Congress in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic painting.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the``triptych") I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It's double, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the locust.
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this analog mesh communicate, where they hide.
This is where the creatures with the head of animals are headed in the headlights, lists to kill themselves in dough by laying into the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is an tested god tied to a stroke.
Billy Graham is in the sea; the Horizons -- the material platform of the Wall spill, the biography of Osama Bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, a kind of a material.
He's coming out of the ocean, and he spit oil in a hand while the other hand comes up with clouds.
Their hands are like banks, and it looks like a mythological being that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a``triptych . ''
It's a little narrative.
That's the hand that I'm talking about.
And then, when you go on the other side, you have a proboscis, like a bird battery, and you spit clouds from this trap.
It also has a five meter tail that joins the``Taliban . ''
Anyway, his tail is going to fire on a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
Their tail ends up in a molecular collapse of color cards in 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards.
Very ahead of their time . This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects: One is called``photographers . ''
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material being encyclopedia, dictionaries or magazines.
But each act as a kind of archive as a human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the same time.
They're like cells, they get together, they divide.
And you can walk between them . It's getting me years.
Each one is basically a microscope microscope that weighs 300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This one has a little cave in the chest.
That's the head; there's the chest, you can go into the entrance.
I'm going to tell you for the rest of the body: there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or Canada, or whatever it has, a kind of an angry thing.
It's a quick repository of these works because I can't explain them for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body that's done by half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange statue.
There's a little forest scene inside the Turkish cavity.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, like the boxes that we live in.
We are in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box . It's called Pennic Rockett.
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio radio, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that makes all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
We're talking about the box and all the people inside of us collide with each other as particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you redefine who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we come to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same material and the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you give them your head?
Take an aspirin.
But for this pill to have effect against pain, first passes through the stomach, the intestines and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and the most engineering system for any drug to be effect in the body.
The downside, though, is that when you bring any drug, it spreads.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take antiretroviral drugs, they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the DNA cells.
But they're also known by their adverse side effects, mostly negative, because in the time that they're going to get to the blood stream, they spread, and worse for the time that they're going to get to their destination, which is where it's more important: in the HIV warehouse.
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is active and not easily enter the bloodstream of patients who are being held to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with current drugs that are a lifelong treatment treatment.
One day, I sat down and I thought,``Could we make the treatment directly to the virus of the virus, without the risk of drugs? ''
As a scientific expert in lasers, the answer was front of me: lasers, of course.
If you use in dentistry, for the care care and surgery of diabetes, they can be used for anything imaginable, including the Australian transport of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
You're like,``How is that possible? ''
We send a small laser laser laser on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cross the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in question of microseconds.
Before I even notice, the hole is immediately repaired.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or in petri plates, but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply the human body.
\" How is that possible?"you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three-dimensional device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make an incision on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, an inject that distributes the drug, releases directly in the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the complete eradication of the body's HIV.
Yeah . A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all HIV researchers -- in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied non-lethal groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or military.
I document what these groups do when they're not shooting.
My goal is to understand these genetic agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent confrontation.
I do fieldwork, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
No.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, from the 14-year-old peace agreement between 1975 and 2011 , 1969 signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these groups; we even have to engage them or defeat them in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they fight, how they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and politicians are related.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less to melt them, without a global view.
armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Robert Lebanese, known by its violent confrontation against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, Robert has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Hall, known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking.
They set up a complex communication machinery: radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the magazine of ISIS, printed in English and published to recruit.
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising of funds without cars, but by profitable business, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
armed groups also do something more: create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they manage hospitals, they put a program program of professional training or loan.
Rolecular offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't provide: security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by war, or even the beginning of the rise of ISIS, can also understand the efforts of these groups for providing security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an extraordinarily elevated price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 in Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario, even in the West, when we look at armed groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid.
They grow because they fill gaps left by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups, participating in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations are these organizations, the less we can self-assemble them as a state.
How do you call a group like Robert?
They dominate part of a territory, they manage all their functions, collect the trash, manage the sewer system.
Is it a state? Is it a rebel group?
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is ISIS?
The lines divide.
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and hybrids, and the more weak the states are, as in the Middle East today, the more they intervene and fill that gap the non-governmental actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more into tools.
filling that government gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and leverage peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we understand better what incentives to offer to foster the transition of violence to non-violence violence.
In this new device between states and non-state actors, military power can win some battles, but we won't give peace and stability.
To achieve these goals, we need long-term investments to fill that vacuum vacuum, to fill that government gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are ventilation, but I'm afraid that accepting openly the label of``feminist would be unfair for the feminist.
I'm a feminist, but pretty bad.
And so I'm struck as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote an article, and a book called``The bad feminist ,"and then in interviews, people started calling me the Michael Mission.
So what started as a personal joke devoted to myself and a deliberate cause, has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth, and at the age of 20, I had strange ideas about feminist, these furry women, angry with men and they hated sex, as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that people were using people when they could be feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was an accusation, a taboo and a nasty word.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which asks too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that rebel woman, until he realizes it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Eventually, as I grew up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are refugee: women are equal to men.
We deserve the same paycheck for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free of harassment or violence.
We have right to use in easy ways and accessible the contraceptives and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing controls or evangelical doctrines.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you need to account our other identities.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality, social condition, skills and much more.
We have to tell these differences and how they affect us, in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are evident, but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear a rap music, folded all volume.
Although the letter degraded the women and offended me deeply, the classic``Bang Shanghai"from the Big Bang Twin is amazing.
\" Do reality with your wet t-shirt.
Zero, give, move until you hurt the shell! ''
Think about it.
pure poetry, right?
I'm completely mortified by my musical tastes.
I firmly believe in man's work, which is all I don't want to do, including -- all the domestic tasks, but also killing insects, the garbage of garbage, the care of the grass and the maintenance maintenance.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
pink is my favorite color.
I enjoy fashion magazines and beautiful things.
And I can see``The Bellink"and the romantic comedy, and I've got a fantastic chance of the fairy tales that make it true.
Some of my crimes are more unknown.
If a woman wants to adopt the speed of your husband, it's your choice, and I'm not who to judge.
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, accept that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is confident so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they choose.
We solved this problem.
I reject the conventional feminism that has ignored or subsidized historically the needs of color women, the workers, the gay and transgender, to favor of white, heterosexual, middle-class women.
Listen, if that's good feminism I am a very bad feminist.
It also happens: as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
So we have this tendency to put up standard feminist.
We hope you're going to stop perfection.
When we were disappointed, we would retire them with a lot of taste from the same pedestal where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster; I've already considered myself from that pedestal before you try to get there.
Too many women, particularly the innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid to be labeled as feminist.
They're afraid to stand up and say,``Yes, I'm a feminist"by fear of what that tag means, for fear I can't be able to meet with a little realistic expectations.
Let's take a example to Skype, or as I call it, the Goddess.
In the last few years, it's a declared feminist.
In the Chicago Museum, Install in 2014, in MTV, he's in front of the word``feminist"three feet tall.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this pop star, openly embracing the feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud.
I spent the time, cultural critics started endless arguments whether Bonnie was or not exactly feminist.
They rank their feminism, rather than just believing the word of adult and mature woman.
We demand perfection of feminist, because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much enormously.
We go far beyond critical and constructive criticism, to design the feminism of any woman, to break it up until there's nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of departure.
But what happens next?
We've gone from recognizing our flaws to realize, going to action and be a little bit more courageous.
If I hear a degrading music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy by providing an unlimited supply.
These artists won't change their way to talk about women in their songs until we demand change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly difficult.
Why has its music that will be so dangerous?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions are justified, this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my nieces, three and four years.
These are two gorgeous girls, decided and brilliant, and also very brave.
It's where they're concerned by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is ever more easy to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as sport, and the Game of Thrones.
We can change radio radio when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film on another part when movies don't treat women more than as decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their teammates as a bathroom.
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say,``No, I'm not going to post in their magazine, participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a enough number of women, so much to participate to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication, or your organization is more inclusive with a broader range of people . ''
Those of us who are represented but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also deny ourselves to be included until more like us are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we're not a few other parts . Without these efforts, without adopting these positions, our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can commit these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, people in the predictable power and film producers and music and music, CEOs, the legislators, the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create lasting and meaningful change.
We can also claim our feminism, good, bad, or anything.
The last line of my book```` Bad Festival ,"he says,``I'd rather be a bad feminist to not be at all . ''
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially, because it's my voice, I was stolen and feminism helped me back.
There was an incident.
I call it increased to deal with what happened.
A few kids were given me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
They stole my voice, and after all I didn't dare to believe I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And with that, I went back to writing.
I remember myself in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what meant living in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and the feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realizing that none of us is nowhere that the world tries to tell us we are.
In a hand, I have power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humiliating reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we could all do the same thing.
I hope we could all be a little brave, when you need such a courage.
Just after Christmas last year , 330 children in California had measles to have visited Disneyland or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infected over 100 children in Quebec.
One of the tragic things about this outbreak is that the measles that can be fatal for a child with a weakened immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century, but many of the children involved in the Disneyland outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were scared of even worse: autism.
But a moment, wasn't the article that was unleashed the contentious of autism and designers, excited and made it a fraud by being a fraud by the British Medical Journal?
Don't you believe the majority of intelligent scientists that the vaccines cause autism is a stupidity?
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still assuming that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatrician who had heard about it, they believed their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates followed stable only three or four children per 10,000.
But then, in the '90s, the numbers started shooting.
fundraising organizations like autism Archievs refer to autism, as a epidemic, as if I could take off another child in Disneyland.
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center of Disease Control Center, what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like``passionate primates ,"and``better detection of cases"to explain these growing numbers.
But that kind of language didn't take a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks on the face of his two-year-old son, visual contact.
If diagnostic criteria had to expand, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1990s?
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow and catalyst progress of science than the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist, Leo Kangle, from the Johns Hopkins Hospital . In 1983, Kenya published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be able to inhabit private worlds, raising people around, even their own parents.
They could get fun for hours by shaking their faces before their faces, but they were prey from the panic as they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, Kangle speculated that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as a primary authority of the world in the subject, I declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome while collecting in such distant places like South Africa.
This is actually not to miss, because the criteria of Rwanda for autism diagnosis were very restrictive.
For example, I was able to give that diagnosis to children with convulsions, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was charged that he had turned to nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to his office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
Kangle was a smart man, but part of his theories were not close.
I classify autism as a form of child psychosis caused by cold and discarded parents.
These kids, he said, have been very carefully kept in a refrigerator that doesn't be discovered.
At the same time, though, Wagner noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that spread in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies before the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said,``Beethoven.
But Wagner had a bad opinion of these skills, making things like the kids were just regurgitating what they had heard of their parents, desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of renewable that autism was rare.
Lingle King, cognitive psychologist from London, thought that the theory of the Nigerian mothers in Boulder was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and affectionate people, and they had a deep autistic daughter called Susliation.
Lingle and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as Susan without support services, without special education, without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National National Service of Health that you needed more resources for autistic children and their families, London and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be 30 years ago before.
They conducted a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
They looked at a London suburb called Mobile to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw, what you saw was clear that the Kangle model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were angry in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the genealogy of reality.
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in beautiful boxes and seals, as Judith said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the monolithic model of Maryland would have predicted.
At first, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody have been noticed before?
But then 59 found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, the next year at the article of Kanzi, and then he forgot, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kangle knew about this article of competition, but he avoided deliberately to mention it in his own work.
There wasn't even an English translation, but luckily, the Spanish husband spoke German, and he translated it to her.
The document offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Perchland, who runs a clinic integrated with a inner school in Vienna in the 1930s.
The ideas of Superman for teaching children learning were progressive even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with kinds of exercises with music, and the kids follow their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents to cause autism, Asperger described it as a political disability of life that required compassionate forms of support and spaces for the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger called their little teachers, and it was dedicated to help developing education methods that were especially adequate to them.
Basically, Asperger saw autism as a continuum that was a continuum of a staggering variety of gifts and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in institutions known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and the teacher teacher.
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a piece of autism is essential.
Lingle and Hunging discovered that CNN was wrong that autism was frequent, as well as the parents were the causes.
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of psychiatry to expand the diagnosis of the diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they called autistic spectrum.
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came in flight, replace the limited model of Kanzi by a wide and inclusive Asperger.
These changes did not fall broken.
And coincidentally, when 59 and Judith worked between the players to reform these criteria, people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out,``Rain Man ,"in 1988, just a little circle, commissioned by experts knew what autism was, but after the non-fortune performance of Dutch Hoffman, and the recognition of``Rain Man"and the recognition of``Rain Man"with four awards of the Academy, pediatrician, psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials of using to diagnose autism.
I don't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his child.
The combination of``Rain Man"changes in criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network effect, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to rise, like London and Hunting, in fact, they hoped that it was, getting people with autism and their families finally get the support and the services they deserve.
So Andrew Spanish came to blame with vaccines for increasing diagnostics, a simple, powerful, an awful credible history, as bad as the theory of Kangle was frequent.
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic is one of the largest minority groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to refuse the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for the new medical breakthroughs, using the term``replication"to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand biodiversity is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows, doesn't mean that it's broken.
According to autistic standards, normal human brain is easily distributed, socially social, and it suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
No doubt, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Asperger, which creates that the cure for the most disabled aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Massach Zapaeza once said,``we need all the hands in cover to learn the boat of humanity.
As we navigate towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
