\begin{answer}

Observe the plot of dataset 1, on x1 axis the data points
roughly follow a Gaussian, but on x2 axis the point density 
looks like a exponential distribution which has a big head
and small a tail. It can also be seen as $\chi^2$ distribution,
which can is just the sum of square of k Gaussians (degree k $\chi^2$),  
which leads to the first two transformation; the third log 
transformation also looks pretty good.
