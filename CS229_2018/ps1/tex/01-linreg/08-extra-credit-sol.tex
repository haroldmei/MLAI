\begin{answer}

Observe the plot of dataset 1, on x1 axis the data point
on roughly follows Gaussian, but on x2 axis the point density 
looks like a exponential distribution which has a big head
and small a tail. It can also be seen as $\chi^2$ distribution,
which can be seen as sum of k Gaussians,  which leads to the 
first two transformation. 

The third log transformation also looking good.
